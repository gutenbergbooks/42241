<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The Institute standard course of study in "Commercial
Law" is not intended to make lawyers, but simply to
impart to bankers sufficient knowledge of law to enable
them to act in accordance with established legal principles,
and refer doubtful questions to a lawyer. It is not usurping
the functions of a lawyer for a banker to know his legal rights
and responsibilities. The banker who does not appreciate the
importance of this knowledge, eventually learns from experience,
sad or otherwise, that he has neglected an important
part of the training necessary to carry on his business with
safety and confidence. This text-book is based on the splendid
work, originally prepared for the Institute, by Samuel Williston,
Weld Professor of Law in Harvard Law School. To this
original matter, however, much new material has been added,
cases have been cited, and new chapters on Master and Servant,
Estates and Trusts, Bills and Notes, and Torts and
Crimes added. The work of preparing "Commercial Law"
has been done jointly by Richard D. Currier, President of the
New Jersey Law School, and Richard W. Hill, member of the
New York Bar and Secretary of the American Institute of
Banking. The main purpose of this book is to teach bankers
to recognize the danger signals in law, when they appear, and
thus be able to distinguish between law and law suits.</p>

<h2><a name="INSTITUTE_PLATFORM" id="INSTITUTE_PLATFORM"></a>INSTITUTE PLATFORM</h2>


<p>Resolution adopted at the New Orleans Convention
of the American Institute of Banking, October 9, 1919:</p>

<p>"Ours is an educational association organized for
the benefit of the banking fraternity of the country and within
our membership may be found on an equal basis both employees
and employers; and in full appreciation of the opportunities
which our country and its established institutions
afford, and especially in appreciation of the fact that the
profession of banking affords to its diligent and loyal members
especial opportunities for promotion to official and managerial
positions, and that as a result of the establishment and maintenance
of the merit system in most banks a large number
of Institute members have through individual application
achieved marked professional success, we at all times and
under all circumstances stand for the merit system and for
the paying of salaries according to the value of the service
rendered.</p>

<p>"We believe in the equitable cooperation of employees
and employers and are opposed to all attempts to limit individual
initiative and curtail production, and, insofar as our
profession is concerned, are unalterably opposed to any plan
purporting to promote the material welfare of our members,
individually or collectively, on any other basis than that of
efficiency, loyalty and unadulterated Americanism."</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>DEFINITION OF LAW.&mdash;The term "law" is
used in many ways. We speak of moral law,
law of gravity, divine law, and the like. In each
case we are making proper use of the term, but in no
instance are we using it as we shall use it in this book.
To illustrate: You find a beggar on your front porch
when entering your house late at night. Suppose he
should ask you for food and lodging for the night.
Although there is no other house within five miles of
your home, you refuse to take him in, or do anything
for him. As a result he contracts pneumonia from
exposure, because he is not able to proceed further.
You would, nevertheless, not be liable in the sense in
which we are using the term "law." But, you say, in
an extreme case of this kind, it is one's duty to act.
We grant it, but to be accurate, you must preface your
proposition with the statement, "under the moral law"
or "under divine law it is one's duty to act in such a
case." However much it is to be regretted that moral or
divine law sometimes does not harmonize with "law"
as we shall treat it, we must, nevertheless, recognize
that fact. Law, as viewed by the jurist, and this is the
way we, as students, are to consider it, is defined by
Blackstone to be "A rule of civil conduct prescribed
by the supreme power in the State, commanding what
is right, and prohibiting what is wrong." Referring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
again to our illustration, is it not easy to see that it
would be impracticable in the present condition of society
for the legislature of California, for example,
to pass a law which should, in that State, constitute
"a rule of civil conduct" commanding that every one
"shall be his brother's keeper" and for a violation
thereof "shall be imprisoned for one year, or fined one
thousand dollars, or both." However much we recognize
the obligation of moral law, jurists and legislators
cannot ignore the fact that society is composed of ordinary
human beings, still far from perfection. Assuming,
although perhaps it is doubtful, that it is within
the power of the legislature of California to pass such
an act as has been suggested, there are not courts
enough in the whole United States to decide the cases
which would arise in New York City alone in attempting
to apply the provisions of such an act. On second
thought, then, it is not such a startling proposition
for us to learn that "law" is not synonymous
with the same term when used in referring to natural
law, moral law, and the like. Much has been written
on the essential nature of "law" as we shall use the
term. The time-honored definition of Blackstone,
which we have quoted, is confessedly imperfect. The
last clause, "commanding what is RIGHT, and prohibiting
what is WRONG" has been much criticized,
and Mr. Chitty has modified it to "commanding what
shall be done, and what shall not be done." Today,
to attempt to buy a bottle of light wine at a hotel does
not seem to many of us intrinsically WRONG, but
legally, under existing laws, it is, and so perhaps Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Chitty's modification of Blackstone's definition does
bring out the correct idea more clearly. For our
purpose, these two definitions are sufficient.</p>

<p>THE SYSTEMS OF LAW.&mdash;There are two
chief systems of law in use among civilized peoples
today, the Roman or civil law, and, the English or
common law. The Roman, or civil law (Roman law is
spoken of as civil law, from the Latin "civilis," belonging
to a citizen) as its name implies, originated in
Rome. As the city of Rome developed into the Roman
Empire, its law became that of the ancient world. It
was finally codified by the Roman Emperor Justinian,
in the year 530 A.D., and was eventually absorbed,
from the twelfth to the eighteenth century, into the
law of modern Europe. It is the basis of the systems
of law used in the countries of continental Europe,
Central and South America, and all French, Spanish,
Portuguese, and Dutch colonies or countries settled
by those peoples.</p>

<p>COMMON LAW.&mdash;The common law had its
roots in the customary law of the Germanic peoples
of western Europe, and was developed by the English
courts from the thirteenth to the nineteenth centuries.
Like the Roman law, it has spread all over the world
wherever English-speaking peoples have settled, and
founded colonies. The common law now prevails in
England, Canada (except Quebec), India, except over
Hindus and Mohammedans in certain instances, and
the principal British colonies, except those in South
Africa. The United States is largely an English settlement,
hence the common law prevails with us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
except in the State of Louisiana, where the influence
of the French and Spanish settlements still remains
and makes the basis of the Louisiana law the Roman
law, and in the Philippines and Porto Rico, where the
law was Roman when we took those possessions from
Spain in 1898.</p>

<p>THE SOURCE OF LAW.&mdash;Where does this rule
of civil conduct we are to study come from? At first
blush, the superficial observer might suggest some
legislative hall where it is created by a legislative body,
a perfect product, to be imposed on men and women
as the guide in their every act in civil life. The slightest
reference to historical jurisprudence will convince
us that this is not the true source of the law. Mr. Justice
Holmes of the United States Supreme Court, in
his classic, "The Common Law," indicates the real
source of law when he observes: "The life of the law
has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt
necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political
theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or
unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share
with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to
do than the syllogism in determining the rules by
which men should be governed. The law embodies the
story of a nation's development through many centuries,
and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only
the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.
In order to know what it is, we must know what it has
been, and what it tends to become. We must alternately
consult history and existing theories of legislation.
But the most difficult labor will be to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the combination of the two into new products at every
stage. The substance of the law at any given time
pretty nearly corresponds, so far as it goes, with what
is then understood to be convenient; but its form and
machinery, and the degree to which it is able to work
out desired results, depend very much upon its past."</p>

<p>WHERE TO LOOK FOR LAW.&mdash;Knowing the
source of law does not necessarily tell us where to look
for the law. Today, in the United States, we have
three primary sources to which the lawyer goes to
seek the law on any particular point. First, the Constitution
of the United States and the Constitution of
the State in which he is to ascertain the law, including
the statutes which have been enacted by Congress and
by the State legislature under those constitutions. Second,
the decisions of the courts, particularly those of
the United States courts and of the State where he
wishes to learn the law, and, if need be, the decisions
of other States. Third, text-books and treatises on the
branch of law to be investigated.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;Let us suppose you wish to
ascertain the law concerning a question that comes up
in your own daily life. Take two problems. First: We
will assume you keep a clothing store, and an infant,
twenty years old, purchases a suit of winter clothes.
His income is $1000 per year. He already has two
perfectly good winter suits. A week after purchasing
this suit, he returns it and demands his money back.
You wish to know whether you have to give it to him.
If you should look in the Constitution of the United
States, or of the State of Vermont (assuming this to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
be a Vermont contract), you would find nothing that
would give you any help in answering this question.
If you should look through all of the acts of Congress
and the laws passed by the legislature of the State of
Vermont, you would find nothing to give you any
help. If, however, you should look in the decisions of
the courts, both of the United States and of the State
of Vermont, you would find cases, probably many of
them, covering this particular situation, and you
would find the rule to be laid down as law, that an
infant (and by an infant we mean anyone under
twenty-one years) is not liable on his contracts, except
for necessities, and then only in a quasi-contractual
action for their reasonable value. Applying the law to
the problem, you would be obliged to admit the legality
of the infant's claim, and if you did not refund the
money to him, he would be entitled to sue for it in a
court. Three winter suits are clearly not necessaries
at one time for an infant with an income no greater
than $1000 per year. This is a comparatively simple
problem. Now let us take another case somewhat
more difficult. You live in New Jersey near the plant
of an airplane manufacturing company. Machines are
constantly being tried out, and they circle over your
premises within four or five hundred feet from the
ground. You have several children who are using your
back yard as a playground and you are much alarmed,
fearing that an airplane may fall in the yard and kill
or injure a child. You wish to ascertain your rights.
You look in the Constitution of the United States, and
of the State of New Jersey. You will find nothing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
either about airplanes. You look in the acts of Congress
and the laws of the legislature of the State of
New Jersey. You will find nothing there to help you.
You look in the decisions of the courts, both of the
United States and of the State of New Jersey. You
will find nothing there. You look in the text-books,
and, except in the most recent, in all probability you
will find nothing there in regard to airplanes. You
may search the recent legal publications and you will
find articles discussing in a purely theoretical way this
interesting topic. You study recent legislation and
you will find stray instances of attempts to deal with
aerial matters. For example, Connecticut has a statute
on airplanes. In fact, your whole search will be most
interesting. All you will find, however, is not law in
New Jersey, but is simply theory, based on common
law principles or statutes having no force in New Jersey.
Should you then conclude that you have no rights,
that the law cannot help you? Perhaps not. If you
turn to treatises relating to the ownership of land as
developed in the English common law and as applied
by the courts in the United States, you will find that
the word "land" is often used as practically synonymous
with realty or ground or soil, and you will also
find that it includes everything attached to the realty
or growing on it. As is commonly said, land has an
indefinite extent upward as well as downward, the old
books using the Latin maxim: "Cuius est solum, eius
est usque ad coelum usque ad orcum." (To whomsoever
the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to
the depths.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three houses in a row on Smith
Street, Nos. 1, 3 and 5. Mary Jones lives in No. 1, and
Sarah Green in No. 5. They are friends, and accordingly
arrange to stretch their clotheslines from their
rear second-story windows across the back yard of
No. 3. Under common law principles, this is a trespass
upon No. 3. Should Mary Jones and Sarah Green continue
to do this for the required time, usually twenty
years, they would acquire by prescription a permanent
right to stretch clotheslines over lot No. 3. When the
owner of lot No. 3 wished to erect a ten-story building
covering all of his lot, he would be seriously interfered
with by the right acquired by his two adjoining neighbors.
He could have protected himself by proper
action in a court when the offense was first committed.
Could not, therefore, the court take this principle of
the common law as to the ownership of land and apply
it to the airplane case? If the owner of lot No. 3 could
prevent the owners of lots Nos. 1 and 5 from stretching
clotheslines across his land, could you not prevent
the airplane from crossing your land, although it is
five hundred feet above the surface of the soil? Twenty
years' continuation of that practice would interfere
with your ability to build a Woolworth building
twenty-five years from now should you desire to do so.
It is simply taking an old principle of law recognized
for centuries, and applying it to new conditions. This
is what we mean when we say that the principles of
common law are capable of indefinite expansion; that
the common law is always growing, or, as Mr. Justice
Holmes puts it, it is the product of "the felt necessities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of the time." As soon, however, as you have secured
an injunction from the court preventing the
airplane factory from practicing its machines over
your land, all of the other property owners in the
neighborhood of the factory decide to protect their
rights, with the result that no airplane can leave the
factory through the air. Does this mean that the
airplane factory must move, and probably be subjected
to the same annoyances in its new location in
a short time? We are coming to realize that airplanes
are necessities. When a necessity and a principle
of law cannot exist side by side, something must
be done to remedy an intolerable situation. The
illustration here used presents what in the course
of a few years, undoubtedly, will become an intolerable
situation, unless remedied in some way. It
has been suggested that we must modify our principles
of the ownership of land, and give airplanes the right
of free passage over the land of any person, when a
certain distance in the air, far enough up to cause no
great amount of danger or annoyance. Such a change
in the law would have to be accomplished by the State
legislature or by an act of Congress for such territory
as Congress has jurisdiction over. No doubt, legislation
along such lines may be expected soon. It will be
simply a repetition of a situation created by a leading
case in New York in 1902.</p>

<p>In Roberson v. The Rochester Folding Box
Company, 171 New York 538, the suit was
brought on behalf of a living person, a young
lady, to restrain a flour company from putting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
likeness upon prints advertising its flour. Mr. Justice
Parker, writing the opinion of the court, held that
there was no principle of law which would authorize
the court to issue an injunction restraining this
unauthorized use of a photograph. This created the
unfortunate situation in the State of New York of
allowing anyone to make use of another's photograph
without that person's consent, for advertising or other
purposes. The court, in its opinion, admitted the unfortunateness
of the situation, observing that "The
legislative body could very well interfere and arbitrarily
provide that no one should be permitted for his
own selfish purpose to use the picture or the name
of another for advertising purposes without his consent.
In such event no embarrassment would result
to the general body of the law, for the rule would be
applicable only to cases provided for by statute. The
courts however, being without authority to legislate,
are required to decide cases upon principle, and so
are necessarily embarrassed by precedents created by
an extreme, and therefore unjustifiable application of
an old principle. The court below properly said that:
'While it may be true that the fact that no precedent
can be found to sustain an action in any given case is
cogent evidence that a principle does not exist upon
which the right may be based, it is not the rule that
the want of a precedent is a sufficient reason for turning
the plaintiff out of court,' provided (I think should
be added)," Mr. Justice Parker continues, "there can
be found a clear and unequivocal principle of the common
law, which either directly or mediately governs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
it, or which, by analogy or parity of reasoning, ought
to govern it." Relief was denied the young lady. The
following session of the legislature corrected the evil
by passing a law making it a criminal offense to use
another's photograph without that person's consent.
This has been a long illustration. It has served its
purpose best if it has left the very distinct impression
that the law is a vital, living, growing thing. True,
its roots are in the dim past, but it lives, and moves,
and has its being in the problems of today. In no field
of law is this more true than in our subject, Commercial
Law.</p>

<p>WHO KNOWS THE LAW.&mdash;The layman is
frequently of the opinion that a lawyer ought to be
able to give him a definite answer as to just what the
law is in a given set of facts. Why is it not possible
to go to the sources which we have been discussing
and from them ascertain definitely what the law is in
a given case? Frequently the lawyer can do this, but
one should not lose respect for the lawyer because
he is not, in many cases, willing to give a definite
answer, but may frame his reply in an opinion beginning
"It would seem that the law in this case would
be, etc.&mdash;" We have already suggested some of the
difficulties that in part answer the question we now
ask. Let us take one more illustration, a striking example
from the United States Supreme Court. Few
would question the statement that that Court is the
highest type of judicial body in the world today. We
are familiar with the rent profiteering legislation enacted
in the District of Columbia, New York and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
least five other States, as a result of the house shortage
created by the world war. The United States Supreme
Court, in the cases of Block v. Hirsh, 254 U.S. 531
and Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman et al.,
254 U.S. 539, held the New York and the District of
Columbia rent profiteering laws to be constitutional,
but this decision is by a vote of five to four, and the
arguments advanced in the two opinions, one by Mr.
Justice Holmes, representing the majority of the court,
and the other by Mr. Justice McKenna, are striking
examples of how strongly the ablest body of jurists
in the United States can differ on a legal question.
Speaking for the majority in Block v. Hirsh, Mr. Justice
Holmes says: "The main point against the law
is that tenants are allowed to remain in possession at
the same rent that they have been paying, unless modified
by the commission established by the act, and
that thus the use of the land and the right of the owner
to do what he will with his own and to make what
contracts he pleases are cut down. But if the public
interest be established, the regulation of rates is one
of the first forms in which it is asserted, and the validity
of such regulation has been settled since Munn v.
Illinois, 94 U.S. 113. It is said that a grain elevator
may go out of business, whereas here the use is fastened
upon the land. The power to go out of business,
when it exists, is an illusory answer to gas companies
and waterworks, but we need not stop at that. The
regulation is put and justified only as a temporary
measure. * * * A limit in time, to tide over a passing
trouble, well may justify a law that could not be upheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
as a permanent change." In the case of Marcus
Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, involving a similar
New York law, Mr. Justice Holmes says: "The chief
objections to these acts have been dealt with in Block
v. Hirsh, supra. In the present case more emphasis is
laid upon the impairment of the obligation of the contract
of the lessees to surrender possession, and of the
new lease, which was to have gone into effect upon
October 1, last year. But contracts are made subject
to this exercise of the power of the State when otherwise
justified, as we have held this to be." Mr. Justice
McKenna, in writing the dissenting opinion in Block
v. Hirsh, supra, and with whom the late Chief Justice
White, and Justices Van Devanter and McReynolds
concurred, says: "If such exercise of government be
legal, what exercise of government is illegal? Houses
are a necessary of life, but other things are as necessary.
May they, too, be taken from the direction of
their owners and disposed of by the Government?
* * * An affirmative answer seems to be the requirement
of the decision. If the public interest may be concerned,
as in the statute under review, with the control
of any form of property, it can be concerned with
the control of all forms of property. And, certainly,
in the first instance, the necessity or expediency of
control must be a matter of legislative judgment. * * *
The facts are significant and suggest this inquiry:
Have conditions come not only to the District of
Columbia, embarrassing the Federal government, but
to the world as well, that are not amenable to passing
palliatives, and that socialism, or some form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
socialism, is the only permanent corrective or accommodation?
It is indeed strange that this court, in
effect, is called upon to make way for it, and through
an instrument of a constitution based on personal
rights and the purposeful encouragement of individual
incentive and energy, to declare legal a power
exerted for their destruction. The inquiry occurs,
have we come to the realization of the observation
that 'War, unless it be fought for liberty, is the most
deadly enemy of liberty.'"</p>

<p>In the Marcus Brown Holding Co. case, he again
says for the same justices: "We are not disposed to
further enlarge upon the case, or attempt to reconcile
the explicit declaration of the Constitution against the
power of the state to impair the obligations of a contract,
or, under any pretense, to disregard the declaration.
It is safer, saner, and more consonant with
constitutional pre-eminence and its purposes, to
regard the declaration of the Constitution as paramount,
and not to weaken it by refined dialectics, or
bend it to some impulse of emergency because of
some accident of immediate overwhelming interest
which appeals to the feelings and distorts the judgment."
No more striking illustration of the most
decided differences of opinion among nine of the ablest
jurists in the world can be found. It is no wonder then
that a lawyer at times hesitates in giving an opinion as
to what the law may be.</p>

<p>THE FUNCTION OF THE COURT.&mdash;An
infant bought a motorcycle on an installment contract
at the agreed price of $325. He made an initial payment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of $125, used the machine a month, damaged it
to the amount of $156.25, and then returned it in this
condition and demanded the return of his $125. These
are the facts in the case of Petit v. Liston, 97 Oregon
464, a case decided in the Supreme Court of Oregon.
The case involves the right of an infant to disaffirm
a contract made by him, when purchasing an
article which is not a necessity. The Oregon court
had never before been called on to determine what
the law in Oregon was as applied to such a situation.
According to the rule in New York, as laid down in
Rice v. Butler, 160 N. Y. 578, the infant could not
recover the $125, but according to the rule in Pyne v.
Wood, 145 Mass. 558, the infant would be entitled to
his money. It thus became the problem of the Oregon
court to refer to the theories back of these two decisions.
After doing so, it approved of the New York
view, rather than the Massachusetts view. This case
indicates the function of a court. If a court, from the
various sources of law which we have enumerated, can
find an exact precedent for the case before it, or can
find a general principle of law which can be applied,
it renders a decision as to the law, as the Oregon court
did. If no law can be found nor any principles which
can be applied, the court is forced to deny the relief,
as in the Roberson case, 171 N. Y. 538, adding, perhaps,
to its opinion, as it did in that case, the suggestion
that it is a matter Congress or a State legislature
might properly remedy.</p>

<p>THE COURT SYSTEM.&mdash;Knowing the function
of a court, the student should then have an outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of the court system of his own jurisdiction. We can
only sketch, in a book to be used generally throughout
the United States, the court systems. Each State has
two sets of courts: the Federal and the State courts.
We have a Federal and a State Government; it follows
that there should be courts to interpret the laws of
each of these two Governments. Matters pertaining
to the United States Constitution, or matters affecting
citizens of different States, are tried in the Federal
courts. The same is true of admiralty and bankruptcy.
There is at least one United States District Court in
each State in the country, and Federal cases are begun
in these courts. If either party is dissatisfied with the
decision, he may appeal to the next higher court. The
entire country is divided into nine Circuit Courts of
Appeal, to which appeals from United States District
Courts are taken. In case either party is dissatisfied
with the decision in that court, he may, in certain
cases, appeal to the court of last resort, the United
States Supreme Court, presided over by a Chief Justice
and eight Associate Justices at Washington. Each
State has its own system of courts. Usually that system
is more elaborate than that in the Federal Government.
There is in each State a court of last resort,
which we would expect to find designated the Supreme
Court of New York, or whatever State it might be.
Frequently there is a misuse of terms, as, for example,
the court of last resort in New York is the Court of
Appeals, and the Supreme Court is a lower court.
This is true in a number of States. In addition to the
court of last resort, there will be a court of general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
jurisdiction, frequently one of these courts for each
county of the State, and then courts for the trial of
smaller cases in the various cities and towns. The
system of appeals is the same as in the Federal courts,
either party who is dissatisfied having a right to appeal
his case to the higher court. The question as to
whether a particular case must be brought in a Federal
court or a State court is too complicated to be
taken up in detail. Sometimes the suit must be brought
in the Federal court, as, for example, a bankruptcy
matter, or a matter involving the United States Constitution,
while in other cases, perhaps the majority,
the suit must be brought in a State court. In other
cases a person may have his option of either jurisdiction,
as where a citizen of Texas wishes to sue a citizen
of Rhode Island, and the amount involved is over
$3000, then either the Federal or State courts of either
State are open to the parties.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
Contracts&mdash;Mutual Assent</h2>


<p>Commercial law is a general term used to
cover the legal rules which relate most directly
to everyday commercial transactions. It is a
term of no exact boundary, but most commercial law
is based in one way or another on the law of contracts,
which is one of the largest subjects in the law. Bills
and notes, for instance, are special forms of contracts.
In order to understand business law at all, therefore,
it is necessary at the outset to have some knowledge
of the fundamental principles of the law of contracts.</p>

<p>DEFINITION OF CONTRACTS.&mdash;What is a
contract? Simply a promise or set of promises which
the law enforces as binding. Any promise, if it is
binding, is a contract or part of a contract. So the
law of contracts in their formation resolves itself into
this: What promises are binding? A man may make
all sorts of promises, but when has he a right legally
to say "I have changed my mind, I am not going to
do what I said I would," and when will he be liable
in damages if he fails to do as he agreed?</p>

<p>CONTRACT TERMS EXPLAINED.&mdash;There
are certain terms in contracts which the student will
find repeatedly mentioned and with which he should
be familiar at the outset. For example, contracts are
spoken of as express contracts, and implied contracts.
By an express contract we mean a contract the terms
of which are fully set forth. Implied contracts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
contracts the terms of which are not fully stated by
the parties. There is a mutual agreement and promise,
but the agreement and promise have not been
expressly put in words. If I say to a man, "I will
buy your horse, Dobbin, for $100" and he replies, "I
will sell you the horse at that price," there is an express
contract. I step into a taxi and simply say to
the driver, "Take me to the Union Station." The
driver says nothing, but takes me there. Here is an
implied contract. By my conduct I impliedly agree
to pay him the legal rate for the distance carried.</p>

<p>FORMAL AND INFORMAL CONTRACTS.&mdash;Contracts
are sometimes also divided into formal
contracts, and simple or parol contracts. There are
three kinds of formal contracts recognized in our system
of law: (1) Promises under seal. (2) Contracts
of record, such as judgments and recognizances. (3)
Negotiable instruments. Of the three, it may be most
difficult to understand why a judgment is included as
a form of contract, because a judgment is simply a
judicial termination of a fact entered in the office of
the county clerk, and generally a lien on the real property
owned by the judgment debtor. The sole reason,
apparently, for calling a judgment a contract, is that
an action of debt may be brought in a court of law
upon such a judgment. Sealed contracts and negotiable
paper will be taken up in a later chapter.
Simple, or parol contracts, are those not embraced
in the three previous classifications which constitute
the formal contracts. The term parol is a little ambiguous,
as it is sometimes used as opposed to a written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
contract, meaning simply an oral one, and at other
times it is used as opposed to the three previous formal
contracts.</p>

<p>UNILATERAL AND BILATERAL CONTRACTS.&mdash;Contracts
are also divided into unilateral
and bilateral contracts. In a unilateral contract, the
contract imposes obligations on one party only. A
promissory note is an example of a unilateral contract.
In a bilateral contract, obligation is imposed
on both parties. John and Mary become engaged to
each other. This is a bilateral contract, and either
may sue the other for a breach. Most important results
flow from the distinction between unilateral and
bilateral contracts. This we shall consider later.</p>

<p>VOID, VOIDABLE AND UNENFORCEABLE
CONTRACTS.&mdash;Contracts are also divided into
void, voidable and unenforceable contracts. Strictly
speaking, a void contract is no contract at all. Some
statutes provide that no action shall be brought on certain
contracts, and declare them absolutely void. A
voidable contract is one which is good until the option
of avoiding it is availed of by the party who has the
option. For example, an infant with an income of
$2000 a year contracts for the delivery of a Packard
automobile on June 1. The car, being a luxury, makes
the contract with the infant voidable on his part, and
he may, before June 1, repudiate the contract and
not be liable in a suit for breach of contract, or he
may, if he choses, abide by the contract, take the car,
and pay the purchase price when it is delivered. An
unenforceable contract is one which in itself is perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
good as a contract, but because of some rule
of law cannot be enforced. For example, A agrees,
orally, with the owner of 1 Broadway, to buy that
property for $1,000,000. The terms of the contract
are understood by both parties. This contract is not
enforceable, because, as we shall see later, the Statute
of Frauds requires every contract for the sale of real
property to be in writing.</p>

<p>CONTRACTS UNDER SEAL.&mdash;There are two
ways of making promises binding, and unless the
promisor fulfils the requisites of one or the other of
these two ways his promise will not be binding. The
first of these ways relates to the form in which the
promise is made; the second relates to the substance
of the transaction, irrespective of the form. The way
to make a promise binding by virtue of its form is to
put it in writing and attach a seal to the writing. It
is often thought that written promises are binding
in any event, or that a promise that is not written
is not binding in any event. Neither of these propositions,
however, is true. A promise is not binding
merely because it is in writing; it is necessary that
something more shall be done. Not only must it be
written, but a seal must be attached in order to make
the promise binding by virtue of its form. Everyone is
familiar with the common ending in written contracts&mdash;"witness
my hand and seal," that is, my signature
and seal.</p>

<p>WHAT IS A SEAL?&mdash;A seal may be&mdash;and was
originally&mdash;made with sealing wax stamped with a
crest, initial or what not. This is still a sufficient seal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
but the common kind of seal is simply a wafer attached
by mucilage to the writing. Another kind of seal, in
use by corporations and notaries especially, consists
simply of an impression made on paper without attaching
any foreign substance whatever. Any of these
methods of sealing a promise is good. In most States
a written or printed scroll with the letters "L. S."
written or printed within, or the word "Seal" written
or printed may also be a seal if so intended. It may
seem a ridiculous formality for the law to attach importance
to this lapping a wafer and attaching it to
the end of a writing. In a way it is ridiculous, but it
is desirable to have some method by which a promise
may be made binding. One method, as an original
question, may be as good as another so long as it is
an easy method, and attaching a seal is an easy
method, and one which makes it possible to make a
promise binding whenever you wish.</p>

<p>CHANGE BY STATUTE OF THE LAW AS
TO SEALED CONTRACTS.&mdash;There has been in
this country a certain hostility to the law of sealed
instruments. It has been thought, with reason, that
some of the rules governing contracts under seal have
by their technicality promoted injustice. This has
certainly been true of an old rule that contracts under
seal could not be altered or discharged by any agreement
not itself under seal. The rule, however, that a
seal avoids the necessity of consideration is a desirable
rule, since it is important to have some means by which
those who so intend may make gratuitous promises
binding. It would be better then to abolish undesirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
incidents of sealed contracts by statute rather than
to destroy totally the legal effect of a seal. However,
in many States the distinction between sealed and
unsealed contracts is totally abolished. In a number
of other States the common-law rule has been changed
by the enactment of statutory provisions to the effect
that sealed contracts shall be presumed to have been
made for a sufficient consideration, but this presumption
is only prima facie, and lack of consideration may
be affirmatively proved, even in the case of a sealed
instrument. And under such statutes unsealed contracts
remain as at common law, i. e., the burden of
proving consideration rests upon the plaintiff who
seeks to enforce such a contract.</p>

<p>REQUISITES OF SIMPLE CONTRACTS.&mdash;Sealed
contracts are comparatively easy to understand.
Simple contracts, which are promises made
binding by virtue of their substance rather than their
form, though called simple, are more difficult to understand,
and more complex. They are also much more
common than sealed contracts. A simple contract is
a promise, or promises, to which the parties have
assented, and for which a price called consideration
has been paid. One may promise as much as he wishes,
orally or in writing so long as he does not attach a
seal to his signature, and then say he does not care to
keep his promise, unless he has both been paid for the
promise and there has been an assent by the promisor
and promisee to the terms of the transaction. Mutual
assent and consideration are, then, the requisites of
simple contracts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>INTENT TO CONTRACT.&mdash;In the law of contracts,
intention, as we ordinarily understand that
term, plays little part. In fact, the Supreme Court
of Connecticut, in the case of Davidson vs. Holden, 55
Conn. 103, said: "It is of no legal significance that the
defendants did not intend to be individually liable, or
that they did not know or believe that as a matter of
law they would be."</p>

<p>It is our overt acts that count in contracts. Or
shall we put it this way: In the eyes of the law overt
acts manifest legal intention. A says to B: "I will sell
you my watch for $25, and you may have until
9 o'clock tomorrow morning to decide." A meets B
the next noon and says to him: "I am sorry you did
not take the watch. It was a bargain." B replies:
"Here is the price, I will take it. I intended to call
you this morning but have been so busy I did not have
an opportunity to do so. I told my wife last night I
was going to accept your offer and I can produce five
witnesses who were in the room and heard me say
so." It is, nevertheless, no contract, for, as has been
said, quoting from an old English case, "It is trite
learning, that the thought of man is not tryable, for
the devil himself knows not the thought of man."
Occasionally there may be the overt act and still no
contract, although the mere formalities of contract
may have taken place. The facts in the case of McClurg
v. Terry, 21 New Jersey Equity 225, were as follows:
The plaintiff was an infant nineteen years of age, and
had returned late in the evening to Jersey City, from
an excursion, with the defendant and a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
young friends, among whom was a justice of the
peace, and all being in good spirits, excited by the
excursion, the plaintiff in jest challenged the defendant
to be married to her on the spot; he in the same
spirit accepted the challenge, and the justice, at their
request, performed the ceremony, they making the
proper responses. The ceremony was in the usual
and proper form, the justice doubting whether it was
in earnest or not. The defendant escorted the plaintiff
to her home, and left her there as usual on occasions
of such excursions; both acted and treated the matter
as if no ceremony had taken place. In deciding the
case, the court said: "In this case the evidence is clear
that no marriage was intended by either party; that
it was a mere jest got up in the exuberance of spirits
to amuse the company and themselves. If this is so,
there was no marriage." The overt act of the parties
manifested no legal intention to be married. Should
we change the facts in the following way, the court
undoubtedly would have held a valid marriage: If,
after the parties had gone through the marriage ceremony,
as recited, they went on a two weeks' honeymoon,
and on their return lived together as man and
wife for a month and then suddenly decided to call
the marriage off, on the ground that it was a joke and
they did not intend the ceremony to be binding, regardless
of what they said as to the transaction, their
overt acts would be taken by the court as showing
their real legal intention at the time the ceremony
was entered into. One more illustration: When leaving
the class tonight, there is a sudden downpour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
rain, and the instructor remarks: "I will give ten
dollars for an umbrella." A student offers an umbrella
and claims the money. Here is an overt act, but
a reasonable person would not take the words used
literally. Generally speaking, agreements made jokingly
and social agreements confer no contractual
rights.</p>

<p>OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE.&mdash;The usual way
that mutual assent is manifested is by an offer and
an acceptance of the offer. Two persons are not likely
to express at the identical minute the same proposition.
It is as a practical matter, then, essential that
one should make a proposition, and if a contract is to
be made, that the other should assent to it. An offer
may be made to one or more specified persons, or to
anyone whomsoever who will do what the offer requests,
as in case of an offer of a reward. An offer is
itself a promise, but is a promise conditional on the
payment of a consideration or return for it either by
some act or some promise from the other party.
According as the offer asks for an act or a promise it
will fall into one or the other of the two great divisions
of simple contracts; one kind is called unilateral
(meaning one-sided), that is, a promise only on one
side; the other is bilateral, a promise on each side.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS.&mdash;Let us give illustrations
of these contracts. We say to John: "We will promise
to give you, John, $100 if you will do a specified piece
of work." That is a proposal to make an exchange
of the work for the money in a sense, but more exactly
it is an offer to exchange an agreement to give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
money in return for the work. We are not saying to
John: "If you will agree or promise to do that work
we will promise to give you the money." We are
saying that we will give him the money if he actually
does the work. That offer requires the actual doing of
the work before it is binding. Until then the price
requested for the promise has not been paid. It is an
offer of a unilateral contract. Again, when we say to
a man: "If you will spade up our garden we will pay
you $2 a day," we are making an offer for a unilateral
contract. We are asking him to spade up the garden;
not to promise to spade it up, but to do it, and when
he does it he can hold us liable on our promise to pay
him $2 a day. The promise will have become binding
because we have been given the payment that we
asked for in our promise. But if we say to a man: "If
you will agree to work for us the next month we will
pay you $100," and the man says, "All right," then we
have a bilateral contract. We are asking him, as the
price of our promise, not to work but to agree to
work, and he has promised to do so. To say "I accept"
is always sufficient acceptance in the case of a bilateral
contract where a promise is requested, but if I
said to you, "I will give you $5 if you will bring me
a book here," it would not make a contract to say "I
accept." I said I would give you $5 if you brought
the book here, and nothing but bringing it here will
form a contract. The offeree must always do what
the offerer asks him. If an offerer asks for a promise,
any form of words indicating assent would be sufficient,
because they would mean, in effect: "I consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to make the promise you specify in your offer." The
form of wording in simple contracts is immaterial.
Any plain language is sufficient for an offer, and as
for acceptance, it does not matter whether the
acceptor says "all right," or "I accept your offer," or
in what form he expresses his assent. The question
is, does he express assent? Now, the offerer is at liberty
to name any consideration in his offer that he
sees fit. He can name, in other words, whatever price
for his promise he chooses to ask. If the person
addressed does not choose to pay that price, all he
has to do is to reject the offer, but he can bind the
offerer only on the terms proposed. Therefore, if the
offerer asks for an act in return for his promise, that
is, asks for an immediate payment, or work, or the
giving of property for his promise, no contract can be
made by the person addressed saying, "All right, I
will do it;" that is not giving the price the offerer
asked. On the other hand, should the offerer ask
for a promise and not for an act, the acceptor must
give the promise asked for.</p>

<p>OPTION WITHOUT CONSIDERATION.&mdash;A
common business transaction that presents very
well the principles governing the formation of simple
contracts is what is called an option. Suppose the
owner of a mine says: "I will sell you this mine for
$50,000, and you may have thirty days to decide
whether you choose to accept the offer or not." Now,
it does not matter whether that statement is oral or
in writing; it is merely an offer, and not binding as
the matter stands as far as we have stated. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
if it were in writing and a seal attached (in a State
where seals still have the force which the common
law gave them) it would be a binding promise to sell
the mine at that price at any time within thirty days.
If there is no seal attached, as long as the offer is
unaccepted and unpaid for, it is not binding. The man
who makes it may say: "I withdraw my offer. It is
true that I promised to keep the offer open thirty days,
but you did not pay me for that promise and I am
going to break the promise. I withdraw my offer."
Any offer for the formation of a simple contract, while
unaccepted, may be withdrawn. But, if before it was
withdrawn and within the thirty days' limit, the person
to whom the option was given says, "Here is the
$50,000 which you said you would take for your
mine," the offerer would then be bound, and would
have to perform his part of the contract.</p>

<p>OPTION WITH CONSIDERATION.&mdash;Let us
change the character of the option a little. Suppose
in consideration of $1000 paid down the owner of a
mine promises to sell the mine for $50,000 at any time
within thirty days. Here the offer, or the contract&mdash;for
it is now more than an offer&mdash;has been paid for,
and it is therefore binding. The person to whom the
offer was made paid $1000 for the promise, therefore
the promisor is bound to keep it. It was not an absolute
promise to give the mine to the buyer, but it was
a promise to sell it to him for $50,000 if he chose to
take it within thirty days; that is a conditional promise.
A conditional promise may be binding and paid
for just as well as an absolute promise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>INSURANCE POLICY.&mdash;Take the case of a
fire insurance policy. That is a conditional promise,
a promise to pay indemnity for the destruction of a
house by fire. Therefore, the performance of the
insurance company's promise is conditional on the
suffering by the insured of loss by fire. An insurance
policy is ordinarily a unilateral contract; the premium
is the consideration or price paid for the promise, and
the promise is binding on the insurance company
from the time when the premium is thus paid. Of
course, the promise is only binding according to its
terms. The insured has bought a conditional promise,
a promise to pay if the house burns down. He gets
that promise, but he will not become entitled to any
money or any damages unless the house burns down
nor unless he complies with the other conditions of
his policy.</p>

<p>GUARANTEE.&mdash;Another kind of a promise
worth referring to is a guarantee. A question arises
whether a business house will sell something to a
buyer on credit, and it decides it will not without a
guarantee. Accordingly, John agrees, in writing, that
if the business house in question will sell James a bill
of goods, John will guarantee the payment of the
price. That means, if James does not pay for the
goods, John will. That is a unilateral contract in
which the promise is conditional, and the consideration
for that promise is the selling of goods to James.</p>

<p>PRELIMINARY NEGOTIATIONS&mdash;ADVERTISEMENTS.&mdash;An
offer is sometimes difficult
to distinguish from other things. Suppose the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
an advertisement. A business house advertises that
it will sell goods for a certain price. Take the case of
a bond list issued by a banking house. The list states
that the banking house will sell specified kinds of
bonds at quoted prices. John receives one of those
lists, looks it over, sees something that looks good to
him, and goes into the banking house and says: "I
will take five of those bonds at the price named here."
The banking house says: "We have sold all the bonds
of that kind that we had;" or it says, "The market has
changed on those bonds and there has been some
advance in the price." Has John a cause of action
against the banking house? He has if that bond list
amounts to an offer&mdash;that is, if the list means that
the banking house offers to enter into a contract with
anyone receiving the list. But it has been held that
that sort of advertisement does not prima facie
amount to an offer, although it might be put in such
clear words of agreement to sell on the part of the
banking house that it would amount to an offer. Generally
an advertisement of this sort, or anything that
can fairly be called an advertisement of goods for
sale, is held to mean simply that the advertiser has
these goods for sale and names a price he is putting
upon them; he invites customers to come in and deal
with him in regard to them. It is an invitation to
come and make a trade rather than a direct offer of
a trade.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;Again to illustrate: You
are looking at a new model of an automobile in a
show-room window. You like it, enter the salesroom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and say you will take the car, tendering the
price. The manager tells you that it is simply their
demonstration car, that he will be glad to book your
order for a car of the same model, and can make delivery
in a month. You are not satisfied, and wish to
sue, claiming that your tender of the price constituted
an acceptance of the dealer's offer. Your position
would be unsound and there would be no recovery
in such a case. The placing of the demonstration car
in the window is simply an invitation to the public to
come in and deal with the seller. On the other hand,
suppose you go into a second-hand automobile salesroom.
There are fifty cars of various makes and
models on the floor and each one is labeled with a
different price. You pick out a 1918 Packard which is
marked $1500. You tender the price to the salesman
and say you will take the car. He refuses to sell. In
this case your tender is an acceptance of his offer to
sell. In the former instance, placing a price on the
demonstration car was not a statement to the public
generally that that particular car was for sale at that
price, but in this case, where the cars are all second-hand
cars, the reasonable interpretation of placing
the price on the 1918 Packard is that that particular
car is for sale. Quite likely, the dealer did not have
any other Packard car in stock and would have no
way of securing any of that model at that price.</p>

<p>ORAL AGREEMENT PRELIMINARY TO
WRITTEN CONTRACT.&mdash;Another case of the
same nature that comes up not infrequently is this:
Parties talk over a business arrangement and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
they say, "As this is an important matter let us put
it down in writing; let us have a written contract
containing what has been agreed upon." When it
comes to drawing up the contract, however, they
cannot agree. One party then says, "Well, we made
a definite oral agreement any way; let us carry that
out." The other replies, "Why, no, all that was dependent
on our making a written agreement." The
settlement of their dispute depends on how definite
and absolute the oral agreement was. It is possible
to make an oral agreement binding, although the
parties do agree and do contemplate that it shall subsequently
be reduced to writing, but generally the
inference is that the oral agreement was merely a
preliminary chaffering to fix the terms of the writing,
and that everything is tentative until the writing is
made and signed.</p>

<p>AUCTION SALES.&mdash;Another state of affairs
involving preliminary invitations is presented by
auction sales. The auctioneer puts goods up for sale,
a bid is made, the auctioneer gets no other bid, and
then says, "I will withdraw this from sale." Is the
auctioneer liable? Has he made a contract to sell
that article to the highest bidder? When the transaction
is analyzed, is this what the auctioneer says in
effect: "I offer to sell these goods to the highest bidder?"
If this is the correct interpretation, then when
the highest bidder says, in effect, "I agree to buy
them," there would be a contract. On the other hand,
if what the auctioneer says is in effect like what the
advertiser says: "Here are some goods for sale, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
do you bid, gentlemen," then the auctioneer is not
making an offer himself. He is inviting offers from
the people before him, and until he accepts one of
those offers from the bidders before him there would
be no contract; and until then the auctioneer could
withdraw the goods. And that is the construction put
upon the auction sale&mdash;that the auctioneer is not
making an offer, but is simply inviting offers. Even
if the auctioneer promises that he will accept the
highest offer, that is, that he will sell to the highest
bidder, his promise to accept the highest bid, not
being paid for, would not be binding upon him were
it not for a statute in some States which, in the sale
of goods, would make an auctioneer bound to keep a
promise to sell without reserve, that is, to the highest
bidder, if he made such a promise.</p>

<p>BIDS OR TENDERS.&mdash;Somewhat similar to
the case of the auctioneer is the case of tenders or
bids for the construction of buildings, or for the sale
of goods to a city or to a corporation. There, too, the
corporation or the city is simply inviting offers. They
do not say, "We offer to enter into a contract with
anyone who makes the lowest bid," but rather, "We
are thinking of entering into a contract, and we want
to receive offers in regard to it." When the offers are
made by the bids or tenders, any or none of them may
be accepted, according as the receiver thinks best. It
is sometimes required by law that public corporations,
like cities or counties, shall accept the bid of
the lowest responsible bidder, but, aside from such
statutes, any or none of the bids may be accepted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>IMPLIED CONTRACTS.&mdash;An offer and acceptance
are ordinarily made by words either spoken or
written; but any method of communication which
would convey to a reasonable man a clear meaning
will serve as well as words. If A goes to his grocer
and says "Send me a barrel of flour," he has in terms
made no promise to pay for the flour, but the natural
meaning of his words is that he agrees to pay. In this
case A used words, though not words of promise; but
the same result might follow where no words at all
were used. Suppose A went into a shop where he was
known, picked up an article from the counter, held it
up so the proprietor could see what he was taking,
and went out; this would be in legal effect a promise
by A to pay for the article. A contract, where the
promises of the parties are to be inferred not from
express words of promise but from conduct or from
language not in terms promissory, is called an implied
promise or contract, as distinct from an express
promise or contract, which is one where the undertaking
is in express language. This difference between
express and implied contracts relates merely to the
mode of proving them. There is the same element
of mutual assent in both cases, and the legal effect
of the two kinds of obligations is identical. There is,
however, another kind of obligation which is frequently
called an implied contract, but sometimes
called a quasi-contract, because it is not really a contract
at all, though the obligation imposed is similar.
If a husband fails to support his wife, for instance,
she may bind him by purchases of goods necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
for her support. She may do this even though he
directly forbids the sales to her. There is obviously
no mutual assent in this case; the husband emphatically
dissents and expresses his dissent, but he is
bound just as if he had contracted.</p>

<p>TERMINATION OF OFFER BY REVOCATION
OR REJECTION.&mdash;Since offers do not become
binding until accepted according to their terms,
up to that time they may be terminated without liability.
This may happen in several ways. In the first
place an offer may be revoked by the offerer. To
effect a revocation he must actually notify the other
party of his change of mind, before the latter has
accepted. We have already stated that offers may be
rejected by the person to whom they are made. For
instance, we say, "We offer you one hundred shares
of stock at a certain price, and you may have a week
to think it over." You say, "I do not care for that
offer, I reject it." You come around the next day and
say, "On reflection I have concluded to accept that
offer." The acceptance is within the seven days which
we originally said might be used for reflection, but
the offer has been terminated by the rejection. There
is no longer any offer open, and consequently the
acceptance amounts to nothing. A troublesome question
in regard to the revocation of an offer for a unilateral
contract is this: Suppose A offers B $5 for a
book and B starts to get it but when he reaches the
door, then A refuses to take the book. The general
disposition is to try to hold that promise binding, and
yet the difficulty is that the offeree has not fully done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
what he was asked to do, and if he chose to turn back
and take the book away he could do so without liability.
He could say, "I did not promise to bring the
book. I brought it part way, the walk was long and
I am going to take it back." If he is thus free to withdraw
it seems impossible to deny that the other party
is equally free. Bilateral contracts are more desirable
than unilateral because in bilateral contracts the
mutual promises bind the parties before they begin
to perform and both parties are therefore protected
while they are performing. In unilateral contracts,
the contract is not completed until the act requested
is fully done. Until then, therefore, either party may
withdraw.</p>

<p>A COUNTER OFFER IS A REJECTION.&mdash;Another
way in which offers may be terminated is
by a counter offer on the part of the person to whom
the offer was made. We say, "We will sell you stock
for $100 a share, and you may have a week to think it
over." You say, "I will give you $99 a share." We
say, "No, we will not take it." You say, "Well, I will
give you $100." You are too late; you rejected our
offer of sale at $100 by saying you would give us $99.
The minute you say you will give us $99, our offer is
rejected. Of course, when you make the counter offer
of $99, if we say we will accept your offer to buy, that
would make a contract. Offers are constantly rejected
by counter offers by people who really intend to enter
into a contract. Suppose A says, "I will lease you my
house a year for $800." You say, "All right, I will
take it if you paper the dining-room." That rejects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the offer. A new offer has been made by the person
addressed, who offers, if the dining-room is papered,
to take the house at $800.</p>

<p>TERMINATION OF OFFER BY DEATH
OR INSANITY.&mdash;An offer is also terminated by the
death or insanity of either party before acceptance.
After a contract has once been formed neither subsequent
death nor insanity terminates liability upon it
unless the contract is of such a personal character
that only performance by the contractor in person
will fulfil it.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;In Beach v. First Methodist
Episcopal Church, 96 Ill. 177, a fund was being
raised to build a new church, and a subscription paper,
as follows, was signed by Lorenzo Beach:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Fairbury, Feb. 14, 1874.<br />
</p>

<p>"We, the undersigned, agree to pay the sum set
opposite our respective names, for the purpose of
erecting a new M. E. church in this place, said sums
to be paid as follows: One-third to be paid when contract
is let, one-third when building is enclosed, one-third
when building is completed. Probable cost of
said church from ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to
twelve thousand dollars ($12,000)."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Beach attached and subscribed to that paper
the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Fairbury, 1874.<br />
</p>

<p>"Dr. Beach gives this subscription on the condition
that the remainder of eight thousand dollars is
subscribed.</p>

<p>
"Lorenzo Beach, $2000."<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>In April, 1875, Dr. Beach was adjudged insane
by the county court. The court held that the "subscription
made by Dr. Beach was, in its nature, a mere
offer to pay that amount of money to the church upon
the condition therein expressed. There is nothing in
the record tending to show that the church, in this
case, took any action upon the faith of this subscription,
until after Dr. Beach was adjudged insane, or
that the church paid money or incurred any liability.
His insanity, by operation of law, was a revocation
of the offer." Suppose a letter for a winter's supply
of coal is sent to your coal dealer and is acknowledged
by him, delivery to be made before October 1. On
September 15, the coal dealer dies, and his estate
refuses to fulfill the contract. In such a case, if you
were compelled to buy coal at a higher price from
another dealer, you would have a cause of action
against the estate for the damage you suffer. The
coal dealer's executor or administrator could very
easily carry out a contract of this character. On the
other hand, suppose you are running a series of lectures
during the winter, and you have engaged a
noted lecturer to deliver six lectures. After he has
delivered three, he dies. In this case, death would terminate
the contract, as this is clearly a contract for
personal services and the executor or administrator
of the deceased lecturer could not perform the contract
for him, as could be done in the case of the coal
dealer.</p>

<p>TERMINATION OF OFFER BY LAPSE OF
TIME.&mdash;An offer may be terminated by delay on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
part of the person addressed. An answer to an offer
must be sent in time, whether mail or telegraph is
used, or whether the parties are dealing face to face.
An offer lapses if it is not accepted within the time
the offer specifies if any time is specified. If no time
is specified, then within a reasonable time. One may
specify any length of time in his offer, and it will
remain open for that time provided it is not rejected
or revoked, and neither party dies or becomes insane,
in the meantime. But frequently offers contain no
express limit of time; then it is a question of what is
a reasonable time, and reasonableness depends upon
business customs, the character of the transaction,
the way the offer is communicated, and similar circumstances.
An offer on the floor of a stock exchange
will not last very long. A reasonable time for acceptance
of such an offer is immediately, and an offer
sent by telegraph will not remain in force long. The
use of the telegraph indicates that the offerer deems
haste of importance. An offer sent by mail will last
longer. An offer relating to things which change in
value rapidly will not remain open for so long a time
as an offer which relates to land, or something that
does not change in value rapidly.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;In the case of Loring v.
the City of Boston, 7 Met. (Mass.) 409, the facts were
that on May 26, 1837, this advertisement was published
in the daily papers of Boston: "$500 reward.
The above reward is offered for the apprehension and
conviction of any person who shall set fire to any
building within the limits of the city. May 26th, 1837.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Samuel A. Eliot, Mayor." In January, 1841, there
was an extensive fire on Washington Street, and Loring,
after considerable effort, was able to secure the
apprehension and conviction of the criminal. He
then sued to recover the reward, which the city of
Boston refused to pay. The ground of defense was
that the advertisement "offering the reward of $500
for the apprehension and conviction of persons setting
fire to buildings in the city, was issued almost
four years before the time at which the plaintiff arrested
Marriott and prosecuted him to conviction."
The opinion of the court reads: "three years and eight
months is not a reasonable time within which, or
rather to the extent of which, the offer in question
can be considered as a continuing offer on the part of
the city. In that length of time, the exigency under
which it was made having passed, it must be presumed
to have been forgotten by most of the officers
and citizens of the community, and cannot be presumed
to have been before the public as an actuating
motive to vigilance and exertion on this subject; nor
could it justly and reasonably have been so understood
by the plaintiff. We are, therefore, of the
opinion that the offer of the city had ceased before
the plaintiff accepted and acted upon it as such, and
that consequently no contract existed upon which
this action, founded on an alleged express promise,
can be maintained."</p>

<p>BOTH PARTIES MUST BE BOUND OR
NEITHER.&mdash;Both parties to a simple contract must
in effect be bound, and until they are, there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
contract. In a unilateral contract, before the promise
becomes binding, the promisee must have actually
performed what he was requested to do, that is, he
must bind himself by actual performance before the
offerer's promise is binding on him. In a bilateral contract,
where each party makes a promise, neither
promise can be binding unless and until the other one
is. So that in the case of the proposed agreement to
lease, as the proposed tenant might refuse to take the
house if the dining-room was not papered, the proposed
landlord has a similar right; that is, since one
is not bound, the other is not.</p>

<p>CONTRACTS BY CORRESPONDENCE.&mdash;Contracts
are often made by correspondence, simple
contracts especially. That raises rather an important
question as to how and when the contract is
formed. Suppose a letter containing an offer is addressed
from Boston to a man in New York. A reply
is sent by him from New York accepting the offer.
That reply goes astray. Is there a contract? Yes.
It creates a contract by correspondence for a letter
to be mailed by the acceptor provided the offerer imposes
no conditions to the contrary, and impliedly
authorizes the use of the mails, as he does by himself
making an offer by mail. But suppose the offerer
in his letter says, "If I hear from you by next Wednesday
I shall consider this a contract." Then, unless
the offerer receives an answer by the next Wednesday,
there will be no contract. It will make no difference
that an answer has been mailed, it must have
been received; that is a condition of the offer. Suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
an offer is made by word of mouth, and it is
accepted by sending a letter. Does the contract then
become binding, irrespective of receipt of the letter?
No, unless in some way the offerer has authorized the
use of the mails in sending such an answer, and if the
circumstances were such that the use of the mails
would be customary, that would amount to an implied
authorization. The use of the telegraph depends
upon similar principles. If an offer is sent by
telegraph, an answer may be sent by telegraph, and
an acceptance started on its way will become binding
although it is never received. Similarly, one may
authorize a telegraphic answer to a letter containing
an offer sent by mail, and if the use of the telegraph is
authorized, a contract will arise at the moment that
the telegram is sent.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS.&mdash;In the case of an option,
if the acceptance was made by mail and lost in the
mails, a binding contract would be formed if the use
of the mail was expressly or impliedly authorized,
and similarly if the option called for payment and a
letter was mailed containing a draft or cash. There
is a right to send a check or draft by mail if the parties
had been dealing by mail. That authority would
be implied. When parties are dealing by mail and
there is a bargain that a check shall be sent, the check
becomes the property of the person to whom it is
sent as soon as it is mailed, and, therefore, when the
letter with the check is put in the mail it operates
as a payment on the option, and the loss of the draft
is not the sender's loss, but the other man's. A lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
draft, however, can be replaced and must be replaced.
Authority to send actual cash by mail would not be
so easily implied, especially if the amount were large,
because it is contrary to good business custom; but if
authority were given, the result would be the same
as in the case of a check. It would, however, be a proper
business precaution to register the letter if it contained
cash. If the offerer, not having received the
letter of acceptance and thinking none had been sent,
sells the property to another person, though not morally
blamable, he would get into trouble. The second
purchaser would get title to the property, supposing
that the property was actually transferred to him.
The lost letter created a contract, but it did not actually
transfer title to the property, and, therefore,
when the purchaser actually got possession of the
property he would become the owner of it and could
not be deprived of his title if he took it innocently.
If, however, the person to whom the property was
transferred had notice of the prior completion of a
contract, he could not keep the property. In any
event the seller would be liable in damages for breach
of the contract completed by mailing the lost letter.
Suppose an option is given by telephone to one who,
just before the option expires, tries to get a connection
by phone to accept and is unable to do so, and ten
minutes after the time has expired a connection is
secured? There is no contract and he has no action.
It is no fault of the offerer that the acceptor was
unable to accept in time, and, generally speaking,
one who wishes to accept an offer must at his peril<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
keep the means of acceptance open. It may be asked
why does not the same principle apply in regard to
mail as to the telephone; that is, why does not starting
the acceptance by telephone complete the contract?
Because there is no authority to send communication
by telephone to the offerer when the acceptor
has no telephone connection. When one
sends an offer by mail the reason that he is bound by
an acceptance sent by mail is because he, in effect,
asks that an acceptance properly addressed to him be
started on its course. He takes his chance as to the
rest, but an offerer by telephone does not authorize
a reply by talking into the telephone when there is no
connection.</p>

<p>MISTAKES IN THE USE OF LANGUAGE
IN OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE.&mdash;Another question
which has to do with the express mutual assent
of parties relates to the meaning of language used.
Suppose an offerer says, "I will sell you a cargo of
goods from the ship 'Peerless,' due to arrive from
India, at a certain price." The buyer assents. There
are two ships named "Peerless," and the buyer thinks
one is meant, but the seller thinks the other is meant.
Is there a contract for the sale of the cargo of "Peerless"
No. 1, or a contract for the sale of the cargo of
No. 2, or no contract at all? The answer is, that
language bears the meaning which a reasonable person
in the position of the person to whom the offer
is made is justified in attaching to it. If a reasonable
person in his position would think "Peerless" No.
1 was meant, then there is a contract for the cargo of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
No. 1. If he was not justified in thinking that, and
ought to have thought No. 2 was meant, although in
fact he did not think so, there was a contract for the
cargo of "Peerless" No. 2. If either meaning were as
reasonable as the other, then each party has a right
to insist on his own meaning, and there would be no
contract. This principle often comes up in contracts
made by telegraph, where the words of the telegram
are, by the mistake of the telegraph company,
changed. For instance, a telegram purports to be an
offer to sell a large quantity of laths at $1 a bundle.
The terms as actually despatched by the seller in
making his offer fixed the price at $1.20. The telegraph
company dropped off the words "and twenty
cents." A telegram is sent back by the buyer, "I accept
your telegraphic offer." Then trouble arises
when buyer and seller compare notes. Well, the offerer
is bound. He selected the telegraph as the
means of communication, and he must take the consequences
of a misunderstanding, which arose from a
mistake of the agency which the offerer himself
selected. The question may be asked: Would there
be any right of action against the telegraph company
by the offerer, the sender of the telegram? The answer
is yes. The company has broken the contract it
impliedly made with the sender to use reasonable
diligence in despatching and delivering the message.
But the trouble with that action is that on telegraph
blanks there is always this in substance: that on unrepeated
telegrams this company is liable for mistakes
only to an amount not exceeding twice the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
cost of the telegram; and it has been held in many
States that that limit on unrepeated telegrams is not
unreasonable. The sender of the telegram has agreed
to the contract on the reverse side of the telegraph
blank, and he ought to have his message repeated if he
desires to hold the company liable in full damages if
his message does not reach the party addressed in
absolutely correct form. In other States, however,
this limitation of liability is held to be against public
policy and the company is liable for the full damage
suffered.</p>

<p>CONDITION IN OFFER REQUIRING RECEIPT
OF ACCEPTANCE.&mdash;An offerer, as has
been said, may insert in his offer any condition he sees
fit. He may therefore insert a condition that an acceptance
shall reach him, not merely be despatched.
The condition may specify the time within which the
acceptance must arrive in order to be effectual. It is
a wise precaution in all business offers of importance
to insert such a condition in the offer. It will not
be sufficient to add to the offer such words as "subject
to prompt acceptance," for prompt acceptance
would be given, within the meaning of the law, by
despatching the acceptance, not by the receipt of it.
The condition should be in such words as "subject to
prompt receipt of your acceptance," or "subject to
receipt of your acceptance," by a stated day or hour.</p>

<p>WHEN SILENCE GIVES CONSENT.&mdash;There
is one way of manifesting mutual assent,
namely, by silence, of which a word should be said.
There is a proverb that "Silence gives consent." Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
it so in law? Suppose a man goes into an insurance
broker's and tosses some policies down and says,
"Renew those policies, please." Nobody says anything
and he leaves the policies there and goes out.
The next night his buildings burn down. Are they
insured? They are, in effect, if the insurance broker
has contracted to renew the policies; otherwise the
buildings are not insured. Now on the bare facts, as
we have stated them, they are not insured; some
other facts must always exist to make silence amount
to assent. If, for instance, on previous occasions, the
broker kept silence when such statements were made
to him, and nevertheless carried out the proposal, it
is a fair inference that he means by his silence this
time what he meant the preceding time. Furthermore,
silence, when the offer is unknown, can never
amount to assent. In the case as we have put it, we
did not say that the insurance broker even heard the
offer; if he did, then the question would depend on
whether he had ever done anything to justify the
other person in believing that silence would mean assent
in such a dealing, or whether business customs
justified the assumption. The offerer cannot by his
own act make the silence of the other person amount
to an acceptance. Suppose an offer of this sort: "We
offer to sell you 100 shares of stock at $50 a share,
and unless we hear from you to the contrary by next
Wednesday we shall conclude that you have accepted
our offer." The offerer does not get any word before
next Wednesday. Nevertheless, there is no contract.
The person addressed has a right to say, "Confound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
his impudence, I am not going to waste a postage
stamp on him, but I don't accept his offer. He has no
business to suppose that if he doesn't hear from me to
the contrary I assent." This sort of case is not infrequently
referred to: A magazine is sent through the mails on a subscription
for a year, the subscription runs out, the magazine is, nevertheless,
still sent. Is the person who receives it bound to pay another
year's subscription? Here you have a little more than silence;
you have the receiver of the magazine continuing to receive it.
If he refused to receive it, undoubtedly there would be no contract,
but where a man takes property which is offered to him, he is
bound by the proposal which was made to him in regard to the property.
He ought to let the magazine
alone if he doesn't want to pay for it. You may say
that the receiver does not know that the subscription
has run out, and if he did he would not take the
magazine. But then he ought to know. He made the
subscription originally. The difficulty is merely in
his own forgetfulness, and he cannot rely on that.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;The leading case of Hobbs
v. Massasoit Whip Co., 158 Mass. 194, is a good illustration.
The plaintiff in this case had been in the
habit of sending eel skins to the defendant and had
received pay from him in due course. The skins in
the shipment for payment of which suit was brought,
were alleged by the defendant to be short of the required
length, and in a condition unfit for use. They
were kept by the defendant some months, and were
then destroyed, without notification to the plaintiff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
The latter sued for the price of the skins and the court
held that the silence of the defendant and failure to
notify the plaintiff that it did not wish to have this
particular lot of skins, amounted to an acceptance.
The court said: "In such a condition of things, the
plaintiff was warranted in sending the defendant
skins conforming to the requirements, and even if the
offer was not such that the contract was made as soon
as the skins corresponding to its terms were sent,
sending them would impose on the defendant a duty
to act at that time; and silence on its part, coupled
with a retention of the skins for an unreasonable
time, might be found by the jury to warrant the plaintiff
in assuming that they were accepted, and thus
to amount to an acceptance."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
Contracts&mdash;Consideration and
Enforceability</h2>


<p>CONSIDERATION MAY BE ANOTHER
PROMISE OR AN ACT.&mdash;The second great
requisite in the formation of simple contracts is
consideration. A price must be paid for a promise in
order to make it binding. The price paid may be another
promise, in which case the contract is bilateral,
or the price paid may be some act actually done or performed,
in which case the contract is unilateral.</p>

<p>ADEQUACY OF CONSIDERATION IMMATERIAL.&mdash;Not
any act, or the promise of any
act, is sufficient consideration, as will be seen. Nevertheless,
in general the law does not attempt to
gauge the adequacy of the consideration; that is,
parties may make such bargains as they wish as far
as the price is concerned. A may say that he will
sell his horse, which is worth $300, for $100, or for a
promise to pay $100. That will be a perfectly good
contract, if accepted, in spite of the fact that the
promised horse is worth more than the promised
price. Such difference in the value of the promise
and the value of the price may go to a great extreme.
The horse may be a thousand-dollar animal, and the
price promised only $100, but when you wish to push
the case to an extreme you are likely to get into this
difficulty: Did the parties really mean to make a bargain?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
If what they were doing was arranging for
a gift of the horse and putting up some little alleged
consideration as a blind, that will not do; but any exchange
the parties really in good faith bargain for,
with certain exceptions hereafter stated, is sufficient.</p>

<p>A SMALLER SUM OF MONEY IS NOT
SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION FOR THE
PROMISE SIMULTANEOUSLY TO PAY OR
DISCHARGE A LARGER LIQUIDATED SUM.&mdash;This
is the principal exception, that in contracts
or promises relating to a fixed sum of money, the
consideration cannot be the simultaneous payment
or discharge of a smaller sum of money on the other
side. If A promises B $100, it will not be good consideration
for B to promise in exchange $50, or even
$99.99, payable at the same time and place. In
other words, the law does require adequacy in exchanges
or agreements to exchange money. A
owes B $100 and says to him, "I can't pay it all," or
"I don't want to pay it all. Will you let me off for
$50?" B replies, "Yes, I will take $50." That
agreement is not binding, and even if the $50 is actually
paid, B may afterwards come and say, "You
paid me only part of the debt you owed me. It is
true I said I would call the whole thing square, but
there was no consideration sufficient in law for my
promise, since you paid me only part of what you
were bound to." This rule of common law, though generally
well established, does not exist or is much qualified
in a few States, such as: Georgia, Maine, Mississippi,
New Hampshire, North Carolina, Virginia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS MAY BE DISCHARGED
BY ANY AGREED SUM.&mdash;The case
cited in the preceding paragraph must be distinguished
from another. Suppose A owes B some money for
services, the price of which was never exactly fixed,
but which B says are of the value of $100. Then if B
agrees to take $50 in satisfaction of his claim against
A, B is bound; the transaction is effectual. The difference
is between what is called a liquidated and an
unliquidated claim.</p>

<p>DEFINITION OF LIQUIDATED CLAIM.&mdash;A
liquidated claim is one of an exact amount definitely
fixed. Such a claim, as has been said, cannot
be satisfied by partial payment or promise of partial
payment. But an unliquidated or a disputed claim&mdash;a
claim subject to a real bona fide dispute, not merely a
dispute trumped up for the purpose of disputing a good
claim&mdash;may be discharged by any payment on which
the parties agree. The law does not know how much
the unliquidated claim is worth, and will allow parties
to bargain for the sale of the unliquidated claim, just
as it will let them bargain for the sale of a horse for
which they may fix such a price as they choose, and
that price will not be revised.</p>

<p>EFFECT OF RELEASES AND RECEIPTS.&mdash;If,
however, the original claim were liquidated and
undisputed, is there any sort of paper the debtor could
get from the creditor that would release him absolutely?
A receipt in full would not do it; a receipt in
full is something to which business men attach more
virtue than it possesses. It is merely evidence of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
agreement to accept what has been received in full
payment and proof may be given as to just what consideration
passed for the receipt in full. As we have
seen, such an agreement is not valid without consideration,
and payment of part of a debt admittedly
due is not sufficient consideration. The really effective
instrument at common law is the release under seal.
That will do the work whether the debtor paid part
of the debt or not, since a sealed instrument needs no
consideration. In jurisdictions where seals have been
deprived of their efficacy at common law an insuperable
difficulty, however, exists. In a few States&mdash;Alabama,
Arkansas, Connecticut, Michigan, Mississippi,
New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Tennessee&mdash;a receipt in full has been given
the effect which the common law gave to a sealed
instrument.</p>

<p>OTHER ILLUSTRATIONS.&mdash;Suppose the
agreement to settle a liquidated claim were oral and
suppose a witness heard the words. Such circumstances
would not make any difference. It is assumed
in all that has been said that the facts are proved.
Suppose that neither party denied the facts. Let the
creditor admit that he did receive this $50 as a full
payment and did give the debtor a receipt in full.
Still, he can say, "I propose to break my agreement
since it was not supported by sufficient consideration,
and I shall collect the balance." Another question is
this: Suppose a man had a $100 bill and he wanted
some change very badly, and another man had $99.
Could the former take that for the $100 bill? He could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
If a man wants a particular kind of money, as gold,
or silver, or quarters, the principles stated do not
apply; they apply only to dollars and cents as such.</p>

<p>PAST CONSIDERATION.&mdash;Strictly speaking,
the term past consideration is a misnomer; something
which is given before a promise is made cannot constitute
a legal consideration. The courts have held
that a warranty made after a sale has been completed
is invalid. It has also been held that a guaranty after
the obligation guaranteed has been entered into also
is invalid unless there be new consideration. Although
this is the general rule, there are several exceptions
where a past consideration is recognized.
Williston gives these exceptions as follows, although
the boundaries between the groups are sometimes indefinite:
"(1) Promises to pay a precedent debt; (2)
Promises in consideration of some act previously done
by the promisee at the request of the promisor; (3)
Promises where past circumstances create a moral
obligation on the part of the promisor to perform his
promise. Under this head may be included cases of
ratification and adoption of promises previously made
for sufficient consideration but invalid when made for
lack of authority or capacity."</p>

<p>PAYMENT OF PART OF A DEBT BY ONE
WHO IS NOT THE DEBTOR.&mdash;Suppose a little
different case: A owes B $100 for a liquidated claim.
A's father says to B, "If you will let my son off, discharge
him from this claim, I will pay $60, not a cent
more." B agrees, and the $60 is paid. Now B never
can get any more; the bargain is binding, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
reason is, that although A was bound to pay the whole
$100, and could not, by paying B a part of the claim,
give good consideration to B for his promise to cancel
the balance. A's father was not bound to pay a cent
and he may bargain for any exchange in return for a
payment which he was not bound to make at all.
Therefore, he may bargain that the debt shall be discharged.</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE OR PROMISE OF PERFORMANCE
OF A LEGAL DUTY IS NOT SUFFICIENT
CONSIDERATION.&mdash;In other words,
the thing which will not be good consideration,
whether done or promised, is the performance or partial
performance of something which the man who
performs or promises is under a legal duty to do
anyway. If he ought to do it anyway, then it will not
serve as a price for a new promise or agreement to
discharge it. Another illustration of that may be
given: Suppose a contractor agrees to build a house
for $10,000; he gets sick of his job when he is about
half through, says that it is not possible for him to
make any money at that price and he is going to quit.
"Well," the employer says, "if you will keep on I will
give you a couple of thousand dollars more." Accordingly
the builder keeps on. That won't do. The
builder in keeping on building is doing no more than
he was previously bound to do. If he wants to have
a binding agreement for the extra $2,000 with his
employer, he must secure a promise under seal, for his
own promise of performance will not support the
promise to pay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>FORBEARANCE AS CONSIDERATION.&mdash;Another
kind of consideration that is worth calling
attention to is forbearance. A has a valid claim
against B. He says he is going to sue. B says if he
won't sue, or won't sue for the present, B will pay
him an agreed sum. That is a good contract so
long as it is not open to the objection referred to a
moment ago; that is, so long as A's claim is not for a
liquidated sum of money and B's promise is not merely
a promise to pay part of that liquidated sum. A may
promise what B requests, either to forbear temporarily
or to forbear perpetually. Either will be good.
But suppose A has no valid claim against B, but B is
reputed to be rather an easy mark in the community
and A is a person of little scruple; he accordingly
trumps up a claim against B with the hope of getting
a compromise. Is forbearance of that claim by A good
consideration for B's promise? It is not. A's claim
must be a bona fide one in order to make surrender of
it or the forbearance to press it, either temporarily or
permanently, a good consideration for a promise of
payment.</p>

<p>STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.&mdash;Another
case of a promise relating to a subject of very frequent
importance in commercial law, and law generally,
is a promise to pay a debt barred by the statute
of limitations, and this occasion requires a preliminary
word in regard to that statute. This statute prohibits
the bringing of an action or a claim after the expiration
of a certain period. It is a different period for
different sorts of claims. Action on a judgment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
most States may be begun within twenty years after
such judgment is rendered; so in some States may an
action on a contract under seal. On the other hand,
ordinary contractual claims generally expire in six
years. Claims in tort, that is, for injury to person
or property, last even a shorter time, but the ordinary
contractual statute of limitations is six years. The
statute begins to run against a promissory note, or
other contract, not from the time when it is made, but
from the time when it is by its terms to be performed.
A note made now, payable the first of January next,
will not be barred until six years from the first of
January, not six years from now; and if it was made
payable in ten years, as a mortgage note might well
be, the statute would not bar it for sixteen years.</p>

<p>PROMISE TO PAY BARRED DEBT.&mdash;It has
been held, though the reasons are not very easy to
explain, that a new promise will revive a debt so far
as the statute of limitations is concerned. There need
be no consideration for such a promise other than the
existence of the old indebtedness; that is said to be a
sufficient consideration, although, of course, it can
hardly be said to be given as a price for the new
promise. Take a promissory note payable January 1,
1905. If nothing happens, that is barred on January
1, 1911, but if in 1911 or 1912 the maker says, in effect,
"I know I owe that old note. I have not paid is, but
I will pay it," he will be liable on that new promise,
and the statute will begin to run again and run for six
years from the making of that new promise. It is not
enough that the debtor should admit that there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
liability; he must promise to pay it in order to make
himself liable. Suppose, instead of a new promise
made after the statute had run in 1911 or 1912, the
maker had said before the maturity of the note, we
will say in the course of 1910, "Don't worry about
that note, I shall pay it," that also will start the statute
running afresh. In other words, the new promise
may be made before the maturity of the note, or before
the statute has completely run as well as after
the statute has completely run. In either case the new
promise will start a fresh liability and keep the note
alive for six years from the time the new promise was
made. Of course, if the new promise is made the day
after maturity of the old obligation, the total effect
will be simply to extend the time of the statute one
day, because only one day of the six years had run at
the time the new promise was made, and counting
six years from the date of the new promise gives only
one day more.</p>

<p>PART PAYMENT OF BARRED DEBTS.&mdash;Not
only will a new promise in express terms keep
the statute of limitations from barring a claim, but
any part payment will have the same effect, unless at
the time the part payment is made some qualification
is expressly stated. A debtor may say, "I will pay
you this part of my debt, but this is all," and incur
no further liability; but a part payment without such
a qualification starts the statute running afresh as
to the balance of the debt. It is by these part payments
that notes are frequently kept alive for a long
series of years. Interest payments are as effectual for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the purpose as payments on account of part of the
principal. A new six years begins to run from each
payment of interest. The debtor may, however, say,
"I will pay you half this debt," or "I will pay you the
debt in installments of $10 a month." Such promises
are binding according to their terms, and do away
with the statute of limitations to that extent, but they
do not enable the creditor to recover anything more
than the debtor promises. A question may be asked
here which is frequently of importance regarding an
outlawed note with a payment of interest thereon
by the maker. Would an endorser who had waived
demand and notice be liable for six years more? Yes,
if the payment was made before the statute had completely
run in favor of the endorser. Otherwise, no.
And if the endorser had not waived demand and
notice, the statute could in no case be prolonged
against him by any act of the maker.</p>

<p>REVIVAL OF DEBTS DISCHARGED BY
BANKRUPTCY OR VOIDABLE FOR INFANCY.&mdash;A
somewhat similar sort of revival of an
old obligation may occur where a debt is discharged
in bankruptcy. If a discharged bankrupt promises to
pay his indebtedness or makes a payment on account
of it, it will revive his old obligation and he will be
liable again. And, similarly, though one whom the
law calls an infant (that is, a minor under the age of
twenty-one) who incurs indebtedness prior to his
majority, can avoid liability (unless the indebtedness
was incurred for what are called necessaries, that is,
food, clothing, shelter and things of that sort); yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
if he promises after he has become of age that he will
pay these debts, from which he might escape, thereafter
he is liable.</p>

<p>CONTRACTS WHICH MUST BE IN WRITING.&mdash;There
is, in some contracts, one other requisite,
besides those already mentioned, necessary to
make them enforceable, and that is a writing. It has
already been said that writing is not, as such, essential
to the validity of contracts, but there are exceptional
kinds of contracts which the law has required
to be in writing for many years. This is by virtue of
what is known as the "Statute of Frauds." This was
passed in England in the year 1676, and is known as
"Chapter 3, of the Statute of 29, Charles II." This
statute was passed for the purpose of preventing
frauds and perjuries which were particularly prevalent
at the time it was enacted. It is doubtful as to
how much good the statute has accomplished. There
is no question that in many cases it has caused fraud
and perjury rather than prevented it. The statute,
however, as passed in England, has been reenacted in
practically every State in this country with slight
modifications, and it is, therefore, a part of contract
law to which attention must be given. Originally,
the statute read as follows: "No action shall be
brought (1) whereby to charge any executor or administrator
upon any special promise to answer
damages out of his own estate; (2) or whereby to
charge the defendant upon any special promise to
answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another
person; (3) or to charge any person upon any agreement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
made in consideration of marriage; (4) or upon
any contract or sale of lands, tenements, or hereditaments,
or any interest in or concerning them; (5) or
upon any agreement that is not to be performed
within the space of one year from the making thereof;
unless the agreement upon which such action shall
be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof
shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be
charged therewith or some person thereunto by him
lawfully authorized." A word of comment is necessary
to explain the general import of these various
sections.</p>

<p>Section 1: An executor or administrator is appointed
to settle a deceased person's estate. He is not
obliged to personally pay the debts of the deceased
person out of his own pocket, if the estate is not sufficient.
His liability is limited by the assets of the deceased,
but if, in order to save the credit of the
deceased or for any other reason, he chooses to promise
"to answer damages out of his own estate" that
promise must be in writing. This is the situation referred
to by this section.</p>

<p>Section 2: This is a very important class and leads
us to call attention to the distinction between a guaranty
and a contract somewhat similar. Suppose A
writes to Jordan, Marsh Company: "Please sell B six
good shirts and charge the same to my account." That
is not a guaranty. A is in that case a purchaser just
as much as if he ordered the shirts sent to himself.
Nor is it any more a guaranty if it was further agreed
between A and B that B should pay A for the shirts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
On the other hand, if A should write to Jordan, Marsh
Company, "Let B have six shirts and if he doesn't
pay, I will," then you would have a guaranty. It is of
the essence of a guaranty that there should be a principal
debtor and that the guarantor's liability should
be only secondary. A guaranty must be in writing.
To put the matter in another way, when there are
three parties to a transaction like the above, the writing
is necessary. Where there are two parties, no
writing is necessary. Where A says to Jordan, Marsh
Company, "Let B have six shirts, and if he doesn't
pay, I will," we have three parties: A, the guarantor;
B, the principal debtor, and Jordan, Marsh Company,
the creditor. This must be in writing. Where A says
to Jordan, Marsh Company orally, "Give B six shirts
and charge to my account," we have simply two parties,
A, the principal debtor, and Jordan, Marsh Company,
the creditor. Hence no writing is necessary. In
connection with this section, it must be kept in mind
that some oral contracts which would be good under
this section may not be enforceable under another
section which we shall refer to later, because the
amount involved is over a specified sum.</p>

<p>Section 3: The agreement referred to by this section
is not the contract or promise to marry, but is
for a marriage settlement such as a promise to make
a payment of money or a settlement of property in
consideration of a marriage actually taking place.</p>

<p>Section 4: Any contract for the sale of land, or
any interest in or concerning land, requires a writing
in order to make it binding. The commonest kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
contracts in regard to land are leases or contracts for
leases. An oral lease creates what is called a "tenancy
at will," that is, the agreement, in so far as it specifies
a fixed term, is wholly invalid, but while the tenant
occupies he must pay at the agreed rate; but he has
no right to stay in; he may be turned out, even though
he pays his rent promptly, on notice equal to the time
between rent days; and, similarly, he has a right to go
out on giving the same short notice.</p>

<p>Section 5: An agreement not to be performed
within a year must be in writing, and this provision
of the statute has been the subject of rather an odd
construction by the courts. The words "not to be
performed within a year" have been construed to
mean "which cannot possibly be performed within a
year." Suppose A hires B for a year from to-morrow
and contrast with that case a promise to hire B for
B's life, or for the promisor's life. Now the first of
those bargains is within the statute and must be in
writing, but the second, although it seems for a much
longer period, being for the whole life of the promisor
or promisee, is not within the statute. The man on
whose death the promise depends may die within a
year, so there is a possibility of performance within a
year. A promise to employ B for all his life, since
that may possibly be done within a year, need not
be put in writing. But a promise to hire a man
for a year from to-morrow cannot be performed in a
year. True, he may die within a year, and then the
contract cannot be enforced, but there will be no performance.
What was agreed, by the parties, was service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
for a year from to-morrow and that cannot possibly
be done earlier than a year from to-morrow.</p>

<p>SALE OF GOODS.&mdash;A contract for the sale of
goods exceeding in value a certain amount must also
be in writing unless part or all of the goods have been
delivered or part or all of the price paid. The value of
the goods which brings a sale within this section of
the Statute of Frauds varies in different States, and
local statutes, therefore, should be consulted to ascertain
the law in this connection.</p>

<p>Besides the kinds of contracts enumerated in
the English statute and which have generally been
adopted in this country there are two or three other
classes of contracts which in a number of States are
required by statute to be in writing. Of this sort is
a contract to make a will. That is not a very common
sort of contract, but sometimes a man promises in
consideration of certain services to make a will in
another's favor. The possibility of fraud in such cases
is considerable. The testator is always dead before
the question comes up, and then if the alleged promisee
were allowed to prove by oral statements a contract
to bequeath the testator's property on terms
which the promisee says were agreed upon between
them, it would afford a chance to produce the same
effect as if oral wills were allowed. So a contract of a
real estate agent for commissions is in some States
required to be in writing. A contract with an agent
empowering him to sell real estate, though not regarded
at common law as within the prohibition of
the section of the statute for the sale of an interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in land to be in writing, is by special enactment in
many States required to be in writing. A contract
for a loan of money reserving a rate of interest higher
than that ordinarily allowed by law is sometimes
required to be in writing.</p>

<p>WHAT CONSTITUTES WRITING.&mdash;The
writing being a matter of proof, it is not essential
that it be made at the time the contract is entered
into. If made at any time before an action upon the
contract is begun, that is a sufficient compliance with
the statute. The writing, in order to be sufficient,
must show who the parties to the agreement are, if
not by naming them, by such a description as points
to a specific person. Thus a letter addressed simply
"Sir," and signed by the party charged, but not containing
the name of the person addressed, is not sufficient.
It is also required that all the terms of the
contract appear in the writing, such as the subject
matter, price, terms of credit or any express warranty,
but, as often happens, they need not all be expressed
in one writing. Contracts are frequently made as
the result of an extended correspondence, and in such
a case the various letters can be put together and construed
as one writing if they obviously refer to one
another, and thus all the terms appear in writing. The
statutes in some States require "subscription" of the
signature, and in that case the signing must be at the
end; but where there is not such requirement a signing
in the body of the instrument is sufficient.</p>

<p>ALTERATION OF WRITTEN CONTRACT
BY SPOKEN WORDS.&mdash;Failure to understand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
observe the rule restricting parol evidence to vary
written contracts leads to a great deal of trouble. The
parol evidence rule is this: Where parties have executed
a written contract purporting to state the terms
of their agreement, the court will not receive evidence
that they orally agreed to something less or more or
different, at or before the time when the written
agreement was executed. That written agreement
is taken as conclusive evidence of the contract made
at that time. In trying to ascertain what the writing
means, however, the court will permit the surrounding
circumstances to be shown, and the meaning
of technical or trade terms or abbreviations may be
proved. It may be shown also that the parties did
not intend the written agreement to be effective
until some particular event happened; but if the writing
was executed as an expression of the intention of
the parties at that time, the only endeavor of the court
will be to ascertain the meaning of the written words
and to enforce them as written. The question of oral
agreements made subsequent to the writing is not so
simple. We must here distinguish between (1) contracts
of which the law requires written evidence
because they are within the Statute of Frauds, and
(2) contracts which the law does not require to be in
writing, but which, nevertheless, are written. Contracts
of the latter sort may be rescinded, added to
or subtracted from by any subsequent agreement
which conforms to the requirements of the law governing
mutual consent and consideration, though of
course it is very desirable, to avoid dispute, that any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
variation or rescission of a written contract should
itself be in writing. If, however, the Statute of Frauds
required the original contract to be in writing, though
it may orally be rescinded, it cannot be varied by oral
agreement. To permit such an oral agreement would
in effect violate the Statute of Frauds by permitting
an agreement partly in writing but partly oral to be
enforced. Thus, if a written contract for the sale of
goods (exceeding in value the amount permitted to
be contracted for orally) was made, and the parties
afterwards orally agreed to change the price, the time
of delivery, or any other terms of the contract, the
subsequent oral agreement would be invalid.</p>

<p>THE LIMITS OF CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS.&mdash;As
a general rule a contract does not impose
liabilities or confer rights on a person who is
not a party to it. It follows from the very nature of
a contract that a person who is not a party to it cannot
be included in the rights or liabilities which it creates,
so that he will be entitled to sue or render himself
liable to be sued upon it. A contract is the result of a
voluntary agreement entered into by the parties.
Therefore, any contractual rights or liabilities existing
by virtue of such voluntary agreement between
Smith and Jones are no concern of White and Black.
They cannot be bound by any of the provisions of
the contract between Smith and Jones, nor can a
breach of that contract give them any rights. There
are apparent exceptions to the rule we have just mentioned.
One is in the case of agency. Here one person
represents another in entering into a contract.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
A contract, however, made by an agent can bind a
principal only by force of a previous authority or a
subsequent ratification, so that really the contract
which binds the principal is his own contract. The
other exception is where the rights and liabilities created
by a contract may pass to a person other than the
original party to it, either by act of the parties themselves
or by operation of law. Such would be the case
where Smith and Jones have performed the terms of
their contract except that Smith has not paid the
agreed amount to Jones. Jones assigns his right to
collect this amount to White. Such an assignment is
permissible, as we will learn when we consider that
subject later on. Such is an assignment by act of the
parties themselves. Even this exception is limited,
as the obligations incurred in purely personal service
contracts are not subject to assignment. Thus, if I
employ artist Greene to paint my portrait, he could
not assign this contract and compel me to accept a
portrait painted by artist Brown.</p>

<p>THE RULE OF LAWRENCE v. FOX.&mdash;We
shall now take up a very generally recognized exception
to the principle we have just discussed. The
question in its simplest form is this: If Smith and
Jones make a contract for the benefit of Greene, may
Greene sue on that contract? From what we have
said in the preceding paragraph a negative answer
might seem to be correct. However, to-day, stated in
general terms, and leaving out of the question the
limitations recognized in various jurisdictions, the
very general rule is that a third party (Greene in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
illustration) may enforce a promise made for his
benefit, even though he is a stranger both to the contract
and to the consideration. In other words, it
is held not to be necessary that any consideration
move from the third party. It is enough if there is a
sufficient consideration between the parties who make
the agreement for the benefit of the third party. So
in the leading case of Lawrence v. Fox, 20 New York
268, where a debtor of the plaintiff had loaned money
to the defendant and the defendant had promised him
to pay the plaintiff, although the plaintiff was not a
party to the contract, it was held that where a promise
is "made to one for the benefit of another, he for whose
benefit it is made may bring an action for its breach."</p>

<p>QUALIFICATION OF RULE.&mdash;We must call
attention to one qualification quite generally recognized.
Under this rule, that a beneficiary may enforce
a contract, it is necessary that the contract must have
been intended for the benefit of a third person. It is
not sufficient that the performance may just happen
to benefit a third person; it must have been intended
for the benefit of a more or less definite person. Thus,
where a county board had entered into a contract with
a construction company which was building a bridge
for it and maintaining a temporary foot bridge during
the operation, by the terms of which contract the construction
company assumed responsibility for all injuries
suffered by pedestrians using the temporary
foot bridge, it was held that a person who was injured
because of the failure to light the foot bridge properly,
was not such a third person as might sue under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
rule of Lawrence v. Fox, on the contract made between
the county board and the construction company.</p>

<p>APPLICATION OF RULE.&mdash;The rule in Lawrence
v. Fox has been applied to contracts under seal
in many jurisdictions, although there are some decisions
to the contrary. A common application of this
doctrine is found in the sale of real property with a
mortgage upon it. The new purchaser as a part of the
purchase price makes an agreement whereby he assumes
the payment of the mortgagee. The question of
whether the mortgagee, who is really the third party
for whose benefit the contract is made, may sue the
new owner, is generally answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>CAPACITY OF PARTIES.&mdash;All persons are
ordinarily presumed to be capable of contracting, but
the law imposes upon some&mdash;in varying amounts and
for their own protection&mdash;disabilities to make contracts
which may be enforced against them; and, upon
some, for considerations of public policy, disabilities
to make enforceable contracts. These persons are (1)
Infants; (2) Insane persons; (3) Drunkards; (4)
Married women&mdash;to a limited extent; (5) Aliens;
(6) Artificial persons or corporations.</p>

<p>WHO ARE INFANTS.&mdash;All persons under the
age of twenty-one are considered infants, except that
in some States, by statute, women attain their majority
at eighteen. The law endeavors to protect those
who have no experience and judgment against the
loss of their property because of their inability to deal
safely with others who might take an advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
that fact. It may well be that one who has nearly
attained his majority is as able in fact to protect his
interests as one of full age, but the essence of the law is
that it is a rule of universal application, and the law
cannot measure the ability in each particular case. To
do the greatest good for the greatest number, therefore,
it conclusively presumes that those under
twenty-one have not yet gained the ability to cope
with others in the preservation of their property.</p>

<p>CONTRACTS OF AN INFANT.&mdash;An infant's
contracts are voidable; that is, though they bind the
other party to the bargain the infant himself may
avoid them. If he avoids them the adult with whom
he contracted is entitled to recover whatever he may
have given the infant which still remains in the latter's
possession; but if the infant has spent or used,
or for any reason no longer has the consideration
which the adult gave him, the infant may avoid his
own obligation if he has not already performed it, and
if he has already performed it he may reclaim what
he has given. After he comes of age, but not before,
the infant may ratify his contracts and they then become
binding upon him. The retention after coming
of age of property received by the infant during his
minority amounts to a ratification. There are a few
obligations of an infant which on grounds of public
policy are binding upon him. This is true of a contract
to perform military service. The marriage of
an infant is binding though his engagement is not.
It is frequently said that his contract for necessaries
is binding; strictly this is not true. The infant is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
liable for necessaries, but his obligation does not depend
upon his contract; it is an obligation imposed
by law&mdash;what has been called a quasi-contract. The
importance of this distinction is shown if the price
agreed upon exceeded the real value of the necessaries.
If the contract were binding, the infant would
be bound to pay the agreed price, but in fact he is
liable only for the fair value. What is necessary for
an infant depends upon his station in life, upon
whether he already has a sufficient supply of the necessary
article in question, and upon whether he is
receiving proper support from a parent or guardian.
The privilege of an infant is generally held to exist
even though the party dealing with him not only reasonably
believed the infant of age, but had received
actual representations from the infant to that effect.</p>

<p>INSANE PERSONS AND DRUNKARDS&mdash;The
law affords protection to insane persons and, to
a less extent, to drunkards, for the same reason as in
the case of infants, namely, that those who are incapable
of understanding what they are doing and of
comprehending the effect of their contracts upon their
property should be safeguarded against the designs
of the more capable. This protection is given them by
declaring some of their contracts void, and allowing
them, or those legally representing them, to avoid all
others with the exception of a few. Also, as in the
case of infants, this privilege as to such contracts is
for the insane person's protection only, and the other
party to the contract may not avoid it by pleading
that it was made with an incompetent person.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>WHOM DOES THE LAW CONSIDER INSANE?&mdash;Modern
science has clearly established that
a person may be insane on one subject, and yet possess
a clear understanding and be perfectly sound on
another. If the contract deals with a subject of which
the person has a clear understanding, he is not in
need of protection and is given none. Those only are
given the protection who do not possess the mind to
understand in a reasonable manner the nature and
effect of the act in which they engage.</p>

<p>BINDING OBLIGATIONS FOR NECESSARIES.&mdash;The
insane must live as well as the sane;
consequently they are bound to pay for necessaries
furnished them but only the reasonable value, as has
been explained in the case of infants. The rules for
determining what these necessaries may be are the
same as in the case of infants.</p>

<p>OTHER CONTRACTS.&mdash;It is often a difficult
matter to know when a person is insane, much more
difficult than it is to determine a person's age. One
of the contracting parties may have acted in perfect
good faith, being ignorant of the other's unsoundness
of mind and having no judicial determination of
insanity or other warning to put him on his guard.
The contract even may be reasonable in its terms, and
it may have been so acted upon that the parties to
it cannot be restored to their original position. In
such a case, while the law should protect the incompetent,
it would be clear injustice to protect him to
such an extent as to make the other party suffer
through no fault of his own. It has been quite generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
determined in this country, therefore, that
where a person does not know of the other's insanity
and there has been no judicial determination
of such insanity to notify the world of it, and the contract
is a fair one, and has been so acted upon that the
parties cannot be restored to their original position,
it is binding upon the lunatic as well as upon the other
party.</p>

<p>VOID CONTRACTS.&mdash;In some States it is held,
however, that all contracts of an insane person are
void. In such States the rule above stated would not
hold. The law of each State must be consulted to
determine the law in the particular State. In some
States, notably New York and Massachusetts, an insane
person's deed of lands has been held to be void,
without reference to whether or not the other party
entered into the contract in good faith without notice,
or that it has been so far acted upon that the parties
cannot be restored to their original position. As in
the case of infants, an insane person's power of attorney
has been declared by high authority to be absolutely
void.</p>

<p>VOIDABLE CONTRACTS.&mdash;In most jurisdictions
an insane person's contracts are voidable by him
or by his guardian, provided (1) that the other person
knew of his insanity at the time of making the contract,
or (2) he had been declared insane by some
court, or (3) the parties can be restored to their original
position.</p>

<p>RATIFICATION AND AVOIDANCE.&mdash;When
the insane person's reason has been restored,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
if the contract is a voidable one, as explained in the
foregoing rules, though he may by acts or words avoid
the contract he made during his insanity, he may in
like manner ratify it, or he may ratify it by not avoiding
it within a reasonable time after recovering his
reason while continuing to keep something capable
of being returned, which he obtained under the contract.</p>

<p>WHAT CONSTITUTES DRUNKENNESS.&mdash;It
is not ordinary drunkenness which excuses a man
from his contracts, and enables him to claim the protection
given generally to incapable persons. The
person must have been utterly deprived of his reason
and understanding, so that he could not comprehend
the nature or effect of the act in which he was engaged.
That he was so much under the influence of
liquor that his judgment was not as good as in his
normal state does not excuse him.</p>

<p>MARRIED WOMEN.&mdash;It is practically impossible
to state in brief form the law upon the subject of
married women's contracts. The difficulty arises from
the diverse changes made in the plain and clear rules
of the common law by statutes in the different States.
The old law is wholly incompatible with the enlightened
view now held in regard to women, their family,
social and business standing, and the changes have
been made to give them the rights to which they are
justly entitled. But, inasmuch as the statutes have
not been uniform in the different States, the law
to-day is not wholly uniform. The statutes and decisions
in each State must be consulted to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the law on the subject as it is to-day. Through these
changes the law has become very complicated, and
business men should obtain legal advice before entering
into important business dealings with married
women.</p>

<p>THE OLD RULE.&mdash;Upon her marriage a
woman's existence became merged in that of her
husband, and the husband and wife were regarded
for many purposes as one person. What tangible
personal property she had became his immediately
upon marriage, and he had the right to reduce her
bills, notes, bonds and other debts to his possession.
Her real property she retained the title to,
subject to the right of the husband to have the use
of it during his life, if children were born of the marriage.
He was bound to supply her with necessaries,
and so long as he did this her contracts for things
of even ordinary use were void; but if he failed to
supply the necessaries her contract for them would
be valid. All her other contracts were absolutely void&mdash;not
voidable. Her position, then, was worse than
an infant's. She could have personal property of her
own only if it was given to someone else to hold the
title and pay over the income to her, and even this
"separate estate," as it was called, could not be bound
by her contracts.</p>

<p>CHANGES MADE BY STATUTE.&mdash;The law
of married women's contracts has been greatly
changed by legislative enactments, to give married
women the rights which the more enlightened view
of the present time accords to them. The first changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
aimed quite generally to give her greater rights over
her "separate estate," giving her power to make binding
contracts with reference to it, or to make binding
contracts if she were carrying on a trade or business
of her own. But the earlier statutes frequently did
not give her power to contract with her husband, or
to make binding contracts if she had no separate
estate, or was not carrying on a separate business.
Later enactments have largely corrected these defects,
but the old rule still stands except as it has been
changed by statute, and, therefore, the statutes of
each State and the decisions interpreting them must
be consulted to determine accurately the law in each
State. It may, however, be said that generally a
married woman may now contract except with her
husband, and except as surety for him. In many
States she can even make contracts of these excepted
classes.</p>

<p>ALIENS.&mdash;An alien is one born out of the jurisdiction
of the United States, of a father not a citizen
of this country, and who has not been naturalized.
In times of peace, aliens may hold property and make
contracts and seek the protection of our courts as
freely as citizens. When war breaks out between
this country and another the making of contracts
between citizens of the two countries is prohibited.
If such contracts are made during a state of war, they
are illegal and void, and the courts of this country
will not lend their aid to enforce them, either during
the war or after its termination. Contracts made
before the war breaks out are good, but cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
enforced, nor can remedies for their breach be obtained,
while the war is in progress. When the war
ceases, however, the courts will lend their aid to the
enforcement of such contracts.</p>

<p>CORPORATIONS.&mdash;A corporation may contract
as freely as an individual so long as its contracts
are within the business powers and scope of
the business which its charter authorizes it to conduct.
And even if a corporation has made a contract
outside of the scope of its business, and the
contract has been acted upon so that either party
has had the benefit of the contract, an action
will lie in favor of the other for the benefits so
conferred. But a contract outside of the business
which its charter permits the corporation to engage
in, and which is wholly executory, the courts will not
enforce. Such contracts are said to be ultra vires.
Contracts with a corporation may be in the same
form as contracts between individuals, and the corporation
need use its seal only where an ordinary
person is required to use one. The officer or officers
making the contract on behalf of a corporation must,
however, be authorized so to do either by the directors
or by the general powers attached to such officers.
In law corporations are deemed to be artificial persons
subject in a general way to provisions governing
natural persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
Contracts&mdash;Performance and
Termination</h2>


<p>PRIMARY RULE.-After a contract has been
formed, it does not make much difference
whether it is under seal or whether it is a simple
contract; the rules governing the contract, subsequent
to its formation, are very much the same though there
are a few distinctions. The primary rule running
through the law, governing obligations to perform
contracts, is that if a man has once formed a good
contract he must do as he agreed, and if he fails substantially
(not merely slightly) to do so the other
party may refuse to perform on his part. If you remember
that fundamental principle you cannot generally
go far wrong.</p>

<p>CONDITIONAL CONTRACTS&mdash;INSURANCE.-What
one agrees to often depends on the
conditions which he includes as part of his promise.
Take the insurance policy previously alluded to. An
insurance company promises to pay $5,000, but it
does not promise to pay in any event; the condition
"if the house burns down" is obviously a qualification
of the promise. But there are other conditions in the
insurance policy. The insurance company says that
it will not be liable if gasoline is kept in the house
beyond a small quantity necessary for cleaning. That,
too, is a condition of its promise to pay $5,000; so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
"if the house burns down," "if gasoline is not kept
in the house," "if the house is not unoccupied more
than three months," and "if mechanics are not allowed
in possession of the property for more than a
certain length of time," are all conditions, and the
company's main promise need only be kept if the conditions
are complied with. That is why an insurance
policy is not always quite as good as it seems&mdash;because
there is a large promise in large print; but there
are a good many qualifications in smaller print which
are really part of the promise and must be taken into
account.</p>

<p>CONDITIONS IN BUILDING CONTRACTS.&mdash;Another
kind of conditional promise often occurs
in building contracts. The employer agrees to pay
the builder or contractor on the production of an
architect's certificate. Now it doesn't do the builder
any good to build that house unless he gets the architect's
certificate, for he has been promised pay only
on condition that he produce it. That is the promise
between the parties. That is the only promise.</p>

<p>WHEN PERFORMANCE OF CONDITIONS
IS EXCUSED.&mdash;It is obvious that these conditions
in promises may be sometimes used to defeat the ends
of justice, and undoubtedly at times they are so used.
A person who draws a contract cleverly will put in a
great many conditions qualifying his own liability,
and will try to make the promise on the other side as
unconditional as possible. The law cannot wholly do
away with these conditions, because in general, so
long as parties do not make illegal bargains, they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
a right to make such bargains as suit themselves. The
court cannot make their agreement for them, but it is
held that if a condition will lead to a real forfeiture
by an innocent promisee, the law will relieve the
promisee. Thus, in the architect's certificate case, if
the house was properly built and it was merely ill
temper on the part of the architect that caused him
to withhold giving the certificate, the court would
allow the builder to recover, and even if the architect
had some good reason for refusing the certificate, the
court would not allow the builder to be permanently
prevented from recovering anything on the contract,
providing the builder had substantially though not
entirely performed his contract and had acted in good
faith. If, however, his default was wilful, if he had
tried to beat the specifications, and the architect had
found him out and therefore refused the certificate,
the only thing the builder could do would be to go at
it again, tear out his faulty construction and build as
he had agreed.</p>

<p>IN CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT,
WORK MUST BE PERFORMED BEFORE PAYMENT
IS DUE.&mdash;There are other matters which
qualify the obligation of a promisor to perform besides
express conditions such as those we have alluded
to. Take this case: John promises to work for the
A. B. Company; the A. B. Company promises to employ
him and to pay him a salary of $1,000 a year.
John comes to work the first day and works a while,
and then he says he would like his thousand dollars.
The A. B. Company says, "Well, you have got to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
your work first." John says, "Why should I work
first and trust you for pay, rather than you pay first
and trust me for the work? I will keep on working,
but I want the pay now." Of course, the employer is
right in refusing to pay until the work has been done,
even though the promise of the employer is not expressly
qualified by the statement that after the work
has been done he will pay $1,000. It has been dictated
by custom, rather than by anything else, that where
work is to be performed on one side and money to be
paid on the other, in the absence of any statement in
the contract to the contrary, the work must be done
before the pay is given. The result is this: that John
must work anyway, his promise to work being absolute;
but the employer's promise to pay the money is,
in effect, conditional. It is subject to an implied condition,
as it is called, that John shall have done the
work he agreed to do. The promise of the employer
is, in effect, "I will pay if you previously have done
the work." But John's promise is absolute: "I will
work." He has to trust for the pay.</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE FIRST DUE UNDER A
CONTRACT MUST BE GIVEN BEFORE PERFORMANCE
SUBSEQUENTLY DUE FROM
THE OTHER PARTY CAN BE DEMANDED.&mdash;And
that case is an illustration of a broader principle
which may be stated in this way: where the performance
promised one party to a contract is to precede in
time the performance by the other side, the party who
is to perform first is bound absolutely to perform;
whereas the party who is to perform subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
may refuse to perform unless and until the other party
performs. In the cases thus far alluded to, the promises
of the two parties could not be performed at the
same time. You cannot work for a year and pay $1,000
simultaneously. One performance takes a whole year
and the other performance takes only a moment.</p>

<p>PERFORMANCES CONCURRENTLY DUE.&mdash;But
frequently there arise cases where both promises
can take place at the same time. The commonest
illustration of that is a contract to buy and sell. You
can pay the price and hand over the goods simultaneously,
and when a contract is of this character, that
is, where both performances can be rendered at the
same time, the rule is that in the absence of agreement
to the contrary, they must be performed simultaneously.
John agrees to buy James' horse and pay
$200 for it, and James agrees to sell the horse for
$200; that is a bilateral contract of purchase and sale.
Now suppose neither party does anything, has each
party broken his promise? It might seem so, for John
has not bought the horse or paid for it as he agreed,
nor has James sold the horse. But where each party
is bound to perform simultaneously with the other,
if either wants to acquire any rights under the contract
he must do what is called putting the other party
in default, that is, he must offer to perform himself.
John, therefore, must go to James, offer $200 and demand
the horse if he wants to assert that James has
broken his contract. And James, on the other hand,
if he wishes to enforce the contract, must go with the
horse to John and say, "Here is the horse which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
will hand over to you on receiving simultaneously the
$200 which you promised me for it." The obligation
of the two promises when they can be performed
simultaneously is called concurrently conditional,
that is, each party has a concurrent right to performance
by the other, and has a right to refuse performance
until he receives, concurrently with his own performance,
performance by the other party.</p>

<p>INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.&mdash;Sometimes
contracts are more complicated than those which we
have stated, such as contracts of service and contracts
to buy and sell. This, for instance, is a type of a very
common sort of contract in business: a leather manufacturer
uses large quantities of tanning extract in
his tannery. He makes a contract for a regular supply,
so many barrels each week for a year, for which
he agrees to pay a specified price a barrel on delivery.
For a time the extract promised him is sent just as
agreed. We will suppose, then, that perhaps the extract
manufacturer is slow in sending what he promised;
there is a delay; perhaps the extract that is furnished
is not as good as it was or as the contract
called for. What can the leather manufacturer do
about it? Of course, he can keep on with the contract,
taking what the extract manufacturer sends him, getting
as much performance as he can, and then sue for
such damages as he may suffer because of the failure
to give what was promised completely. But he does
not always want to do that. Suppose it is necessary
for his business that he should get tanning extract
and get it regularly. He does not want to wait and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
take chances on the extract manufacturer's delays in
delivery and inferiorities in quality. He wants to
make a contract with somebody else and get out of
his bargain with the first extract manufacturer altogether.
May he do so? No question in contracts
comes up in business more often than that. And the
answer to the question is this: it depends on the materiality
of the breach, taking into consideration the
terms of the contract and the extent of the default.
Is the breach so serious as to make it fair and just in
a business sense to call the contract wholly off; or
will justice be better obtained by making the injured
party keep on with the contract and seek redress in
damages for any minor default?</p>

<p> BREACH IN CONTRACTS
OF EMPLOYMENT.&mdash;The same thing
comes up very often in contracts of employment. Suppose
an employer hires an employee for a year, and
in the course of the year the employee at some time
or other fails to fulfill his contractual duty as an employee.
He is negligent and in some respect fails to
comply with his contract to render good and efficient
service. Can the employer discharge him? We must
ask how serious is the breach. A merely negligent
breach of duty is not so serious as one which is wilful.
Or the breach might be on the other side of the contract.
Suppose the employer has promised to pay a
certain sum each month as salary during the year,
and does not pay promptly. Has the employee a
right to say, "You pay my salary on the first day of
the month as you agreed, or I leave"? No, he does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
not have a right to speak so positively as that. A
single day's delay in the payment of one month's installment
of salary would not justify throwing up a
year's contract. On the other hand, if the delay ran
along for any considerable time, it would justify the
employee in refusing to continue. You will see that
this principle of materiality of the breach on one side,
as justifying a refusal to perform on the other, is
rather an indefinite one. It involves questions of degree.
That is so in the nature of the case. The indefiniteness
of the rule, therefore, cannot very well be
helped.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS AND DISTINCTIONS.&mdash;A
few concrete illustrations may help to bring out the
points under discussion. Suppose an agreement for
the sale of real estate, and, for instance, the buyer is
unable to be on hand the day the sale is to be completed,
and the owner is present, and, finding the buyer
absent, immediately sells the land to another. Now is
there any action against the owner, or might he justly
refuse to go on with the contract because of the momentary
breach of contract? No, he cannot refuse to
go on in the case of a contract of that sort to sell real
estate, unless the contract very expressly provided
that the transaction must be carried through at the
specified time and place or not at all. The case would
be governed otherwise by the principle of materiality
of the breach, to which we have alluded. A brief delay
would not be a sufficiently material breach to justify
the seller in refusing to go on, but a long delay, of
course, would be sufficient. In sales of personal property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
time is regarded by the law as more important
than in sales of land. In contracts to sell stocks varying
rapidly in value, time is a very important element.
Suppose now that an option for a piece of land was
given by the owner. May he dispose of the land
to another a few minutes after the time specified in
the option for the acceptance of the offer? That is
different from the case previously put. The option is
in effect an offer to make a sale, and the offer is by
its terms to expire, we will say, at 12 o'clock, noon,
October 23. It will expire at that time, and an acceptance
a minute later will be too late. The difference
is in the terms of the promise made by the different
parties. In the case put first, there is an unqualified
contract to buy and sell. In the case now put there is
a promise to sell only if the price is tendered or if acceptance
is made prior to 12 o'clock, noon, October
23. The terms of the option, assuming in its favor
that it was given for consideration or was under seal
and therefore not merely a revocable offer, were expressly
conditional. The vital thing in contracts is to
be sure of the terms of your promise. The term option
indicates a right which exists up to a certain point;
beyond that point there is no right.</p>

<p>PROSPECTIVE INABILITY OF ONE
PARTY EXCUSES THE OTHER.&mdash;There is one
other thing besides actual breach by his co-contractor,
which justifies one party to a contract in refusing to
go on with the contract, and that may be called prospective
inability to perform on the part of the other
side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY.&mdash;Let us
give one or two illustrations of that. You have entered
into a contract to sell a merchant 100 barrels of flour
on thirty days' credit. The time has come for the delivery
of the flour, but the merchant is insolvent. He
says to you, "I want you to deliver that flour; the
agreed day has come." You say, "But you cannot pay
for the flour." "Well," he replies, "it is not time to
pay for it. You agreed to give me thirty days' credit:
perhaps I shall be able to pay all right then. I have
not broken my promise yet, and as long as I am not
in default in my promise you have no right to break
yours." You have a right to refuse to deliver the flour
because, though the buyer has not yet broken his contract,
the prospect of his being able to keep it, in view
of his insolvency, is so slight that his prospective inability
to perform in the future, when the time comes,
excuses you from going on now. Insolvency or bankruptcy
of one party to a contract will always excuse
the other party from giving credit or going on with
an executory contract, unless concurrent performance
is made by the insolvent party or security given for
future performance.</p>

<p>REPUDIATION.&mdash;Repudiation of a contract
by one party is also a good excuse. Repudiation means
a wrongful assertion by one party to a contract that
he is not going to perform in the future what he
agreed. After such repudiation the other party may
say, "I am not going to perform now what I agreed to
perform, since you have said you will not perform in
the future what you agreed. I shall not go ahead and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
trust you, even though I did by the contract agree to
give you credit, in view of the fact that you have now
repudiated your agreement by saying that you are not
going to do what you agreed." Repudiation may be
indicated by acts as well as by words, and often is
indicated partly by words and partly by acts.</p>

<p>TRANSFER OF PROPERTY TO WHICH
THE CONTRACT RELATES.&mdash;Still another illustration
of prospective inability arises where a contract
relates to specific property, as a certain piece
of land, and before the time for performance comes,
the owner of the land, who had agreed to sell it we will
suppose, transfers it to somebody else or mortgages it.
The man who had agreed to buy that piece of land
may withdraw from the contract. He may say, "You
might get the land back at the time you agreed to perform,
but I am not going to take any chances on that.
I am off the bargain altogether."</p>

<p>IMPORTANCE OF EXACT PROVISIONS
IN CONTRACTS.&mdash;So much for the rather difficult
subject of the mutual duties of parties to a contract in
the performance of it. The best way to avoid doubt
or uncertainty in such matters is to provide very exactly
in the contract what the rights of the parties
shall be in certain contingencies. The law always
respects the intention of the parties when it is manifested,
and it is only when they have said nothing
about their intention that the rules which we have considered
become important.</p>

<p>FRAUD.&mdash;The next question in regard to contracts
arises out of certain grounds of defense that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
may come up and the most important of these is
fraud. Fraud is deception; it is inducing the other
party to believe something which is not true, and, by
inducing him to believe that, influencing his action.
The ordinary way in which fraud is manifested is
by misrepresentations. A purchase or sale of stock
or of goods may be induced by fraud. A loan may be
obtained from a bank by fraud, that is, by misrepresentation
of material facts which influence the other
side to act.</p>

<p>MISSTATEMENTS OF OPINION ARE NOT
FRAUDULENT.&mdash;Now what kind of misrepresentation
amounts to fraud? There must be misrepresentation
of a fact. Merely misrepresentation of
opinion is insufficient and what is opinion and what is
fact has been the basis of a good many lawsuits. John
offers his horse to James for sale at $300. He says that
it is the best horse in town. Well, it is not the best
horse in town by a good deal, but that sort of statement
cannot be the basis of an allegation of fraud.
That a thing is "good," or "the best in the market," or
similar general statements, all of which ought to be
known to the hearer to be simply expressions of
opinion, are not statements of positive fact. Take
these two statements in regard to the horse. "He can
trot very fast." That is a mere statement of opinion.
To some minds eight miles an hour is very fast; to
more enterprising persons fifteen miles an hour is
necessary in order to make travel seem fast. Those
are matters of opinion. But a statement that the horse
can trot twelve miles an hour, or has trotted one mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
in three minutes on the track, are statements of fact,
and if untrue are fraudulent. A statement of value is
a statement of opinion and cannot be the basis of
fraud. A statement that the horse is worth $300, or is
worth twice as much as the owner is asking for him,
cannot be relied upon; but a statement that $300 was
paid for this horse, or was offered for him, is an assertion
of fact, and if untrue would be the basis of an
allegation of fraud.</p>

<p>PROMISES ARE NOT FRAUDULENT BECAUSE
BROKEN.&mdash;A promise is not a statement of
fact. A man may promise to do something and fail to
carry out the promise, and in consequence the person
he was dealing with may regret the bargain he entered
into, but his only remedy is to sue for damages
for breach of the promise if it was part of a
contract. He cannot assert that merely because the
promise was not kept the transaction was fraudulent.
But if a man makes a promise knowing when he makes
it that he cannot keep it, he is committing a fraud.
The commonest illustration of this is where a man
buys goods on credit, having at the time an intention
not to pay for them, or well knowing that he cannot
pay for them.</p>

<p>STATEMENTS MUST HAVE BEEN CALCULATED
TO INDUCE ACTION.&mdash;Generally
speaking, the statement relied on as fraudulent must
have been made with the purpose of inducing action.
For instance, suppose John likes to tell large stories.
He tells James things about his neighbor's horse.
John does not do this for any purpose except to brag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
about living near a man who has such a splendid
horse, but James suddenly takes the notion he would
like to have that horse and he goes and buys it. Now
it was not legal fraud on John's part to tell those
lies about the horse, even though they did induce
James to go and buy it, unless John, as a reasonable
man, ought to have known that James was likely to
buy the horse, as might have been the case if James
had been talking about buying him. Then it would
be fraud, and it would not make any difference in
regard to its being fraudulent that John had nothing
to gain by telling these lies, that he was simply doing
it for the fun of the thing.</p>

<p>REMEDIES FOR FRAUD.&mdash;What remedy
has the defrauded person? The law gives him two
remedies of which he may take his choice; he cannot
have both, but he can have either. One is to sue
the fraudulent person for such damages as have been
suffered, and the other is to rescind the transaction,
to get back what has been given, or to refuse to go on
with the contract at all if it is still wholly executory.</p>

<p>DURESS AND UNDUE INFLUENCE.&mdash;There
are certain defences similar to fraud; duress, or
undue influence, is one of them. However, this is
comparatively rare. It is compelling a person to do
what he does not want to do, making him agree to a
bargain that he would not agree to accept under compulsion,
as by fear of personal violence or imprisonment;
and a bargain made under these circumstances
can be rescinded or set aside. Merely threatening to
enforce your legal rights by suit against another is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
duress, though it may in fact induce him to agree to
what he would not otherwise have agreed; but to
threaten criminal prosecution as a means of extorting
money or inducing an agreement is illegal and in many
jurisdictions is itself a crime.</p>

<p>MISTAKE OF FACT.&mdash;In certain cases, also,
a mutual mistake of a vital fact is ground for setting
aside a contract, but these cases are not very common.
Mistakes generally do not prevent the enforcement
of contracts. Usually where there is a mistake,
it is of a character for which one party or the other
is to blame. If the mistake arises out of deception
it is fraud. If the mistake arises simply because the
mistaken party has failed to inform himself of the
facts, as he might have done, then it is no defence at
all. But if both parties were acting under the mutual
assumption that some vital fact was true in making
a bargain, either one of them may avoid or rescind
the bargain when it appears they were both mistaken.</p>

<p>IMPOSSIBILITY.&mdash;Impossibility is sometimes
a defence to the performance of a contract. Perhaps
the simplest illustration of this arises in a contract
for personal services of any kind. Illness or death
of the person who promises the services excuses performance.
Death does not usually terminate a contract
or serve as a defence to it. If a man contracts
to sell 100 bushels of grain and dies the next day his
estate is liable on the contract just as if he continued
alive; but if he agreed to hire a man as an employee
for a year, his death or the employee's death within
the year would terminate the obligation of both. Unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
difficulty is not impossibility. For instance,
take a building contract: the builder agrees to put up
a building within a certain time; he is prevented by
strikes. Nevertheless, he is liable for not doing as
he agreed. He should have put a condition in his
promise, qualifying his agreement to build, that if
strikes prevented, he would not be liable. So, if the
foundation gave way and the building tumbled down
before it was finished, the builder must put it up again.
Also, if lightning struck it, he must put it up again.</p>

<p>ILLEGAL CONTRACTS.&mdash;One other matter
to be considered in connection with contracts and
defences to them is illegality. Some kinds of illegal
contracts are so obviously illegal that it is not necessary
to say anything about them. Anybody would
know that they were illegal and that they could not
be enforced for that reason. A contract to steal or
murder or take part in any crime is a good example.
But other kinds of illegal contracts are not so obviously
wicked as to make it clear that they are unenforceable.
It may be worth while to mention a few
of these kinds of illegality.</p>

<p>CONTRACTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE.&mdash;One
class of contracts which has become very important
in late years in business is the contract in
restraint of trade, so called. The original contracts
in restraint of trade were contracts by which one
man agreed that he would not thereafter exercise his
trade or profession, the object generally being that
the promisee should be freed from the competition
of the man who had promised to refrain from exercising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
his trade; and the law became settled a good
many years ago that if the promise was general not to
exercise the trade or profession anywhere, or at any
time, it was illegal, but that if it was only for a reasonably
limited space of time it would not be illegal.
That old law still exists, but there has grown up
further a much more important class of cases where
contracts are made to further an attempted monopoly,
and one may say pretty broadly that all such attempts
are illegal. It does not matter how much
business reason there is for it; any attempt to combine
in order to get a monopoly, or in order to put up prices,
is bad. Moreover, if the attempted restraint of trade or
monopoly concerns interstate commerce, the agreement
is a Federal crime under the Sherman law.</p>

<p>GAMBLING CONTRACTS.&mdash;Another kind of
illegal contract is a gambling contract. This seems
obvious in agreements for the more extreme kinds of
gambling, but in certain business transactions where
the matter becomes important, the dividing line is not
so clear; especially in dealings on stock exchanges and
exchanges for sales of staple products, such as grain,
cotton and coffee. The stock exchanges and other
exchanges are made the means of a great deal of
speculation, which is virtually gambling. Now, in
what cases does the law regard these transactions as
gambling and, therefore unenforceable, and in what
cases are they legal? The answer is, if an actual delivery
of the stock, or commodity bought, is contemplated,
then the transaction is not gambling in the
legal sense; but if a settlement merely of the differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
in buying and selling prices is contemplated, as the
only performance of the bargain, then the transaction
is gambling. The difference is between a stock-exchange
business and a bucket-shop business. If you
give an order to a stock-exchange house to buy stock,
even though you put up but a small margin and could
put up but a small margin, and the stock-exchange
house knows you could put up but a small margin,
nevertheless, the stock-exchange house actually buys
that stock, and it is delivered to it. The stock-exchange
house would then have a right to demand of
you that you pay for that stock in full and take delivery
of it, and could sue you for the price if you failed
to comply with the demand. However, as a matter
of fact, it does not ordinarily do that. If it wants to
get the price which you promised to pay, and you
fail on demand to take up the stock, it sells the stock
which it has been holding as security. The bucket-shop,
on the other hand, though it takes your order
to buy, does not actually buy the stock; it simply
settles with you when you want to settle, or when it
wants to settle, because the margin is not sufficiently
kept good, by calculating the difference between the
price at which the stock was supposedly bought and
the price at which it is supposedly sold, those prices
being fixed by the ruling market quotations at the
time. It would be perfectly possible to make a gambling
transaction out of the stock-exchange transaction
by a very slight change. If a stock-exchange
house should agree, for instance, that the customer
should not be compelled to take delivery of the stock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
then that added agreement would make the transaction
between broker and customer a gambling transaction,
even though the broker actually bought the stock
on the exchange, and, as between himself and the
other broker on the exchange with whom he dealt,
there was a perfectly valid sale of the stock. In some
jurisdictions, by statute, speculative contracts which
are not gambling contracts at common law are made
illegal.</p>

<p>BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES.&mdash;Another
very important class of illegal transactions
arises from breach of fiduciary duties. A fiduciary
is rather hard to define. He is somebody that owes
a duty higher than a mere contractual obligation, a
duty involving something of trust and confidence. A
trustee is a fiduciary, so is an agent. A director or
officer of a corporation is a fiduciary, and any dealing
in which a fiduciary violates his duty to the person
for whom he is fiduciary is illegal, and any agreement
for such a violation is an illegal contract. It is illegal
for a trustee to bargain for any advantage from his
trust other than his regular compensation. It would
be illegal for a trustee to bargain with a bank to give
the bank a trust account in return for some personal
advantage, as a loan to be made to the trustee personally.
It would be a breach of fiduciary duty for a
corporation officer and director to bargain for any personal
advantage by virtue of his official action.</p>

<p>KNOWLEDGE OF ANOTHER'S ILLEGAL
PURPOSE.&mdash;The knowledge of another's illegal
purpose will not make the person who knows of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
himself guilty of illegality; but if one not only knows
but in any way promotes the illegal purpose of another,
he will be considered a party to the illegality.
A may sell goods to B, knowing that B is going to
use them illegally, and A's sale will not be illegal;
but if A does anything to help B in using them illegally,
or if the goods are of such a character that
they can be used only illegally, then A would be
guilty of illegality himself.</p>

<p>MEANING OF ASSIGNMENTS.&mdash;Much of
the difficulty regarding assignment of contracts is
due to different meanings which may be attached to
the word assignment. When property is assigned
the assignee becomes the owner in every sense, if the
person from whom he took the assignment had a valid
title. This is not true of the assignment of contracts.
By the common law, contract rights or "choses in
action," as they are termed in law, were not assignable,
the reason being that one who contracted with
A, cannot without his consent become bound to B.</p>

<p>POWER OF ATTORNEY TO COLLECT A
CLAIM.&mdash;Though when a man had a contract right
he could not by common law make B in a complete
sense the owner of the claim, he could give B a power
to collect the claim as his, A's, agent, and authorize
him to keep the proceeds when the claim was collected.
It long ago became established that when an
owner of a claim purported to make an assignment of
a claim he thereby gave the assignee the power to enforce
the claim in his stead, and this power given the
assignee is irrevocable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS.&mdash;It
may be supposed that the effect of an assignment
of a right, though the result may be worked out by
treating the assignee as an agent or attorney of the
assignor, is the same as if the assignee were fully
substituted in the position of the assignor as owner
of the claim, but this is not quite true. Assuming
that the claim is not represented by negotiable
paper, the legal owner of the claim is still the assignor.
This is shown by the fact that if the debtor
pays the assignor in ignorance of the assignment, the
debt is discharged and the assignee can only go
against his assignor for the latter's fraudulent conduct
in collecting the claim after having assigned it.
So, too, if the assignor makes a subsequent assignment,
this subsequent assignee also has a power of
attorney to collect the claim and keep the proceeds;
so that if the second assignee in good faith collects
the claim in ignorance of the prior assignment, he
can keep what he has collected; nor is the debtor
liable to the first assignee who must as before seek
redress from his assignor. It is, therefore, always
important for the assignee of a non-negotiable chose
in action to give immediate notice of his assignment
to the debtor. If after such notice the debtor should
pay the assignor or a subsequent assignee, such payment
would not discharge the debtor, and the first
assignee could collect the claim from him.</p>

<p>NON-ASSIGNABLE RIGHTS.&mdash;Rights cannot
be assigned which are personal in their nature.
The one who has contracted to paint a picture cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
delegate the duty to another, no matter how
skillful. One who has a right to the personal services
of an employee cannot assign that right to another.
A publisher who has a right to publish all books written
by a certain author cannot assign his right to
another publisher.</p>

<p>ASSIGNMENT OF DUTIES.&mdash;The duties under
a contract are not assignable under any circumstances.
That is, one who owes money or is bound
to any performance can not by any act of his own or
by any act in agreement with any other person except
his creditor, divest himself of liability and substitute
the liability of another. This is sufficiently obvious
when attention is called to it; for otherwise debtors
would find an easy practical way of escaping from
their debts by assigning the duty to pay to irresponsible
persons. But the principle is not always recognized.
A person who is subject to a duty, though
he cannot escape liability, may delegate the performance
of his obligation provided the duty is of such
a character that performance by an agent will be substantially
the same thing as performance by the obligor
himself. Thus if a contractor engages to build a
house, he may delegate the actual building to another,
but he cannot escape responsibility for the work. One
who owes a mortgage may delegate the payment of
the mortgage to a purchaser of the land who assumes
and agrees to pay the debt. If the purchaser of the
land actually pays, the debt is discharged; but if he
fails to do so, the mortgagee may sue the original
mortgagor and the latter will be obliged to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
another action against the purchaser who promised
to pay the debt and failed to do so. So where a partnership
is changed and a new firm formed, it is very
common for the new firm to assume the obligations of
the old firm.</p>

<p>ORIGINAL DEBTOR NOT DISCHARGED
UNLESS THERE IS A NOVATION.&mdash;Though a
creditor cannot be deprived of his right against his
original debtor without his consent, he may consent.
If he does thus consent to take in lieu of the obligation
of his original debtor that of the person who assumed
the debt, what is called a novation is created. That
frequently happens where a new firm succeeds an
old one. The new firm goes on dealing with the old
creditors, and they impliedly, if not expressly, assent
to taking the new firm instead of the old firm as a
debtor. But in order to make out a novation you have
got to find as a fact that the creditor agreed to give
up his right against the old debtor. If the creditor
does not assent to a novation then the situation is
that the creditor retains his claim against the old
debtor, but the person who has assumed the debt has
contracted to pay that debt. If he keeps his contract
he will pay it and the debt will be cancelled. If he
does not keep his contract the creditor will sue the
original debtor and the original debtor will sue the
man who assumed the debt.</p>

<p>ASSIGNMENT OF BILATERAL CONTRACTS.&mdash;In
bilateral contracts each party is under
a duty to perform his promise, and also has a
right to the performance of the other party. If an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
attempt is made to assign such a contract the effect
is this: the assignor delegates to the assignee the duty
of performing the assignor's promise, but the assignor
himself still remains liable if his agent, the assignee,
fails to carry out the duty. Further, the assignor
authorizes the assignee to receive the payment or performance
due from the other party to the contract
and to keep it for himself.</p>

<p>WHAT AMOUNTS TO AN ASSIGNMENT.&mdash;No
particular words are necessary to constitute an
assignment. Any words which show an intention
that another shall be the owner of a right are sufficient
to constitute the latter an assignee. Especially it
should be observed that an order directed to a debtor
of the drawer ordering him to pay the debt to a named
payee, is an assignment of the debt when delivered to
the payee. This case must be sharply distinguished
from a bill of exchange or check. A bill of exchange
or check is an order to pay a certain amount unconditionally,
irrespective of the existence of any particular
fund. It is only an order to pay from a particular
fund, that is, an order which is conditional expressly
or impliedly on the existence of that fund, which constitutes
an assignment.</p>

<p>PARTIAL ASSIGNMENT.&mdash;A creditor may
not only assign his whole claim to an assignee, but
he may assign part of it. Such a partial assignment
authorizes the assignee to collect the portion of the
claim assigned and keep it for himself. But the debtor
is not bound to pay the claim piecemeal; he may insist
on making but a single payment unless his contract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
with his creditor provides otherwise. A bank in accepting
a deposit contracts to pay that deposit in
such amounts as the depositor may indicate on the
checks drawn by him, but an ordinary debtor who
owes $100 cannot be required to pay in such amounts
as his creditor may see fit to demand. For this reason
a few courts hold that even if the debtor has notice
of a partial assignment, he may pay the whole debt to
the original creditor though that results in defrauding
the partial assignee. Most courts hold, however,
that the debtor when notified of the facts cannot do
this, and if he objects to paying fractional parts of his
indebtedness he must pay the whole sum into court
to be distributed by it among the parties entitled. So,
on a question of this character, the local statute
should be examined.</p>

<p>ASSIGNMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS.&mdash;Assignments
of future claims, as well as of existing
claims, may be made, but there are in many States
some special provisions of statute law in regard to
assigning future wages. Such assignments must
often be recorded, and there are certain other special
statutory provisions in regard to them. The assignment
of future debts is also subject to this qualification:
The law does not allow the assignment of a
future claim unless the contract or employment out
of which the claim is expected to arise has already
been made or is already in existence.</p>

<p>DISCHARGE OF CONTRACTS.&mdash;Contracts
are discharged in much the same way as they are
made. The simplest way of discharging a contract is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
by performing it. When both parties do exactly what
they agreed to do the contract is discharged by performance.
Where seals still retain their common law
effect, it may be discharged without performance by
agreement under seal that it shall be discharged, just
as a contract may be made by an agreement under
seal. The agreement under seal to discharge a contract
is called a release. You may release any right
that you have&mdash;a right for money, a right to have
work done or any right. Just as contracts may be
made either under seal or by an agreement with consideration,
so they may be discharged not only by a
release under seal but by an agreement for rescission
of the contract. But this agreement must have consideration.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS.&mdash;Suppose A has promised
to build a house and B has promised to pay $10,000
for it. Before anything has been done, A and B agree
to call that contract off. This is a valid agreement for
rescission, because each party agrees to give up something&mdash;one
party to give up his right to have the house
built, the other party to give up the right to get
$10,000 pay. So an agreement between employer and
employee that a contract shall be terminated before
the time originally agreed has sufficient consideration&mdash;the
employer gives up his right to the employee's
services, the employee gives up his right for
future pay. But compare with these this case: A owes
B a thousand dollars; it is simply a debt. A and B
agree to call that square. That agreement is of no
validity, for here only one party agrees to give up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
anything. The creditor agrees to give up his thousand
dollars, and he does not get any promised amount in
return for it. But that obligation, that debt, could be
satisfied if valid consideration were given for the surrender
of the claim; and anything agreed upon, as a
horse, or ten shares of stock, or anything else the
parties agreed to, would be good consideration for
the agreement to surrender the claim, so long as one
did not get into the difficulty alluded to under the
heading of consideration, of trying to surrender a
right to a larger liquidated sum in consideration of the
payment of a smaller sum of money.</p>

<p>SENDING A CHECK AS FULL PAYMENT.&mdash;It
is very common for a debtor in making payment
by check of his debt to seek to make the check operate
as a receipt in full of all claims by the creditor against
him. He may do this by writing on the check itself
that it is "in full of all demands" or "in full payment"
of a certain bill; or he may by a letter accompanying
the check state that the check is sent as full satisfaction.
The acceptance by the creditor of the check
under either of these circumstances is an assent by
him to the proposition stated on the check or in the
accompanying letter, that the check is in full payment.
Such an assent, however, does not necessarily
prove that the debtor is discharged; consideration as
well as mutual assent is essential to the validity of
any agreement which is not under seal. Accordingly
if the debt was a liquidated and undisputed one, and
the check was for less than the amount due, the agreement
of the creditor to take it in full satisfaction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
not supported by sufficient consideration under principles
previously considered. On the other hand, if
the debt was an unliquidated one, or there was an
honest dispute in regard to the amount due, the creditor's
claim is fully satisfied.</p>

<p>RECEIPT IN FULL.&mdash;It may be said generally
that though a receipt in full is often thought by
business men to be a discharge irrespective of consideration,
like a release, this is not true in most States.
A receipt in full is good evidence, if payment has been
made in full, that it has been so made; but where payment
has not been made in full a receipt will not be
effectual without consideration, as a release under seal
would be.</p>

<p>RENUNCIATION OF OBLIGATION ON
NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.&mdash;There is one
case where the law allows a party who has a right to
surrender it without consideration. This is by virtue
of the Negotiable Instruments Law, which provides
that the holder of a note may discharge any party to it
by a written renunciation of his claim. No particular
form of words is necessary, but the renunciation must
be in writing. No consideration is necessary.</p>

<p>ALTERATION OF WRITTEN CONTRACTS.&mdash;The
alteration of a written contract in a material
particular with fraudulent intent by a promisee in effect
discharges the contract so far as he is concerned. He
cannot enforce it either in its original form or its
altered form, though the other party to the contract
may enforce it against him. If the alteration is not
material, the contract may be enforced even by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
party who altered it whatever the motive of the alteration
may have been. If the alteration is material but
not fraudulently intended, that party is generally allowed
to enforce the contract in its original form. No
alteration by a third person affects the rights of a
party to a contract. By material alteration is meant
one which if given effect would alter the legal obligations
of the parties to the contract. The rule of the
Negotiable Instruments Law in regard to alteration
of negotiable instruments, it should be observed, is
somewhat more severe than that generally prevailing
in regard to other contracts.</p>

<p>SUGGESTIONS FOR DRAFTING CONTRACTS.&mdash;While
it is unwise to attempt the drafting
of any contract at all complicated, without the services
of an attorney, there are certain times when it
may be necessary to act suddenly, and a few fundamental
facts should be kept in mind. If you are called
upon to draft a contract for two other people, the first
requisite is to obtain as full information as possible
from both parties as to the plans they have in mind.
After obtaining this, the details should be arranged
in writing, gone over carefully by the draftsman, and
submitted to the parties for their approval. A most
common mistake made by laymen is to fail to cover
contingencies which are more or less likely to happen.
For example, what effect would the death of either
party have on the contract? This should be provided
for. The careful draftsman, whether he be a layman
or a lawyer, should draw contracts with the idea of
making them so plain that litigation will not result.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Contracts should always be drawn in duplicate, so
that each party may have a copy, and it is well, if
you are the draftsman, to keep a copy for yourself. It
is not necessary to appear before a notary public unless
you are dealing with a deed, or a similar formal
document. If there is good consideration for the contract,
no seal is necessary, but under some statutes, a
sealed contract is good for a longer period of time, so
that there is an added advantage in having the contract
under seal.</p>

<p>QUASI CONTRACTS.&mdash;The term quasi contract
is one which has appeared within the last thirty
years. The law in this branch of contracts is still in
the process of development and the field of quasi contracts
is still not one of settled limits. For our purposes
we confine ourselves to those obligations arising
from "unjust enrichment," that is, the receipt by one
person from another of a benefit, the retention of
which is unjust. The term "enrichment" has recently
been criticized by one of the ablest writers on this
topic, as there are many cases where it is sufficient to
show that the defendant has received something which
he desired, although the question whether he is thereby
enriched, is immaterial. In Vickery v. Ritchie, 202
Mass. 247, we find that where A renders services, and
furnishes materials and supplies for the erection of a
building for B under a supposed contract and the contract
itself is invalid, B is under a supposed quasi contractual
obligation to pay A for the services he has
rendered and the material he has furnished, regardless
of whether B's property is increased in value. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
may state the point to be emphasized in quasi contract
is the fact that the retention of the benefit received by
the defendant would be unjust rather than "enrichment."</p>

<p>DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS.&mdash;There
are four characteristics which distinguish quasi-contracts:
1. The obligations of quasi contracts are imposed
by law without reference to the assent of the
obligor. 2. They are imposed because of a special
state of facts and in favor of a particular person and do
not rest upon one at all times and in favor of all persons.
3. Although equitable in their origin they are
enforced by a common law court. 4. They require
that the obligee shall be compensated for the benefit
which he has conferred upon the obligor and not for
any loss suffered by the obligee.</p>

<p>APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE.&mdash;The
following are the more common illustrations of the
application of the principles of quasi contracts.
Where there has been a mistake, and hence the minds
of the parties never really met, yet benefit has really
been conferred; or, where the attempted contract cannot
be enforced as a contract, because it did not comply
with the statute, or was illegal, and yet one of the
parties has received a benefit; or, where a benefit has
been conferred under compulsion or duress.</p>

<p>MISTAKE.&mdash;Where parties have attempted to
make a contract and a mistake of fact occurs, no contract
results. The minds of the parties never really
meet. Yet if benefits have been conferred, justice requires
that the benefit should be returned, or compensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
given, and this, in fact, is just what the law
seeks to do when there has been such a mistake that
upon the attempted contract itself no suit can be
brought. The essentials of mistake, and the way in
which a mistake usually arises, are:</p>

<p>(1) It would not be a mistake if a party had paid
money when he had any reason to suppose it was not
due. A recovery of money under such circumstances
cannot be allowed.</p>

<p>(2) The payment must have been induced by mistake
in order to allow the recovery. This rule prevents
the recovery of money paid in settlement of a
disputed matter; but it must be assumed that it was to
the party's interest to make the payment. However,
suppose that a compromise settlement has been made
in the belief that certain facts were different from
what they really were. Here the mistake would have
induced the payment, and, hence, in such a situation a
recovery will be allowed.</p>

<p>(3) The fact regarding which a mistake has been
made must also be a material fact, and the fact must
have been a part of the transaction itself, not collateral
to it in any way. A mistake as to the value of an
article purchased, for instance, is not a material fact.</p>

<p>(4) Ordinarily, money paid under mistake of law
cannot be recovered, although it is against conscience
for the defendant to retain it. A mistake as to the law
of another State, however, is a mistake of fact, and
money paid under such a mistake can be recovered.</p>

<p>(5) Where the party who mistakenly parted with
the money did so because of his own negligence, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
allow a recovery would throw a loss on the other
party, he cannot recover what he parted with. One
party cannot make another suffer because of his own
negligence. Where a party paid money under mistake,
and the payee was negligent, the party paying
may recover.</p>

<p>(6) When parties suppose they have made a contract,
and money has been paid, or services rendered,
under that supposed contract, but in fact there was no
valid contract at all, or there was a mutual mistake as
to a term, this money, or the value of the services, may
be recovered.</p>

<p>(7) When money has been paid for the transfer
of something by defendant, whether recovery will be
allowed in case it should turn out that the defendant
had no title, depends on the nature of transaction. If
the defendant made a warranty that he had title, a
recovery may be had. If, however, the defendant
simply sold what he had, whether that was something
or nothing, a recovery cannot be allowed unless,
as is the law in some States, a vendor impliedly
warrants his title by the fact of having possession.</p>

<p>(8) In the case of parties mistaking the existence
of a subject matter of sale, if the understanding was
that A was purchasing an existing thing, then he can
recover the money paid if it should turn out that the
thing was not in existence. But if he bought simply a
chance, he cannot recover.</p>

<p>BENEFITS CONFERRED UNDER COLOR
OF CONTRACT.&mdash;Aside from the cases of mistake,
there are other grounds for allowing recovery under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the principle of quasi contract. A group of these is
made up of cases where there cannot be a recovery
upon the contract itself, although the parties have
come together and agreed without any mistake or
misunderstanding, because of the absence of some
essential necessary to create an enforceable contract
obligation; yet a benefit has been conferred upon the
one party who, but for the lack of that essential, would
have been liable in an action upon the contract itself.
Such cases arise largely where there has been a partial
performance of an illegal contract, or of a contract
unenforceable because of non-compliance with the statute
of frauds, or where full performance is excused by
impossibility. Some States also allow recovery on
the theory of benefits conferred, where, after partial
performance, a party defaults under circumstances not
excusing default.</p>

<p>BENEFITS CONFERRED WITHOUT CONTRACT.&mdash;We
next take up that class of relations
where there has been an absence of distinct offer and
acceptance, and yet a benefit has been conferred resulting
in an unjust enrichment of the other party.
If A confers benefit on B, though at B's request, it
may be merely a gift. A cannot afterward change his
mind and recover for that, as if there had been a contract.
A may have paid B's debt in order to prevent
a sale of his own property. He may then recover the
amount so paid. For example, A left his property
with B to have some repairs made. A third party
recovered a judgment against B, and A's property
was seized on an execution. A paid the judgment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
order to release his own property. It was held that he
might recover the money so paid from B, who should
have paid the judgment. Or A may have paid B's
debt because he was surety for B. He then may recover
from B the amount so paid; or, if B had two
sureties, A and C, and A paid the whole or more than
his share, he could recover the share of such payment
which C should have paid, on the principle of contribution
that equality is equity. But A must have actually
made the payment of more than his proportionate
share.</p>

Principal and Agent; Master and
Servant</h2>


<p>THE IMPORTANCE OF AGENCY.&mdash;Now
that we have finished our discussion of the general
principles of contract law, it remains for
us to apply these principles to the specific topics of
commercial law. Of these, the law of agency is one of
the most important. It is perfectly obvious that a
man can be in only one locality at a given time. Under
modern business conditions he may wish to perform
acts in different places at the same time. When business
men were first confronted with problems of this
kind, the principles of the law of agency began to develop.
They resorted to the simple expedient of having
others represent them. If these representatives
were properly instructed in their duties and faithful
in discharging them, there was, of course, no reason
why the will of the person who had appointed them
was not as fully accomplished as if he had performed
the act himself. The Latin maxim, "Qui facit per
alium facit per se," that is, "He who acts through another,
acts himself," is the basis of the law of agency.
The growing importance of the law of agency is strikingly
apparent in one branch of modern business.
Fifty years ago, the great majority of business operations
were conducted either by individuals or by partnerships.
To-day, especially in conducting large business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
enterprises, corporations have replaced individuals
and partnerships. Although (as we shall see
later in the chapter on corporations) in law a corporation
is deemed a separate, legal entity, distinct from
the stockholders, in actual practice we know that
there is no such distinct physical being as a corporation.
It follows, therefore, that every act performed
by a corporation must be performed through an
agent. With the enormous increase in the number of
corporations in the last twenty-five years, and that
increase still continuing, we can see that the law of
agency is a most important branch of commercial law
and very closely connected with corporation law.</p>

<p>AGENCY DEFINED.&mdash;Merely for purposes of
convenience, it may be best to divide the whole subject
of agency into three branches: Principal and
agent; master and servant; employer and independent
contractor. The term "agency," when used in
the broad sense, indicates a relation which exists
where one person is employed to act for another. At
the outset, we should keep in mind the distinctions
between the agent, the servant, and the independent
contractor. It is difficult to indicate these distinctions
with absolute certainty by definition. An illustration,
however, will show clearly what the difference
is. I own an apartment house in New York, but as I
am not in the city, except infrequently, I employ the
real estate firm of Smith &amp; Jones to manage the
apartments and collect the rents. They are, of course,
my agents, to act in the premises. I own an automobile
and I employ a chauffeur to operate the car for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
me. He is my servant. I own a vacant lot in New
York and on it plan to erect an office building. I employ
the Smith Construction Company to erect the
building. It is an independent contractor. What is
the rule, then, to determine the distinction between
these three persons? All three persons represent the
principal, or the master, or the employer, but the line
of distinction lies here: An agent is employed to bring
the principal into new contractual obligations; a servant
represents his master in the performance of ministerial,
or mechanical acts or services, with no
thought of bringing his master into new contractual
relations with third persons. A person who is employed
to perform ministerial or mechanical acts for
another, as we have said, is a servant, but there are
cases where the master retains no control or right
of control of the means or methods by which such
work is to be accomplished. In this latter case, the
person performing the work is not a servant, but is an
independent contractor.</p>

<p>HOW AGENCY MAY ARISE.&mdash;Although
agency undoubtedly originated from the relationship
of master and servant, and that relationship from the
enforced service rendered by slaves to their master,
to-day the law of agency in the broad sense is a contractual
relationship. The agent or servant or independent
contractor becomes such upon the express
or implied request of the principal. Although agency
may exist, in so far as third persons are concerned,
without any formal contract between the principal
and the agent, yet, in the great majority of cases, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
is an actual contract between the parties to the relation.
Compensation, although usually an element in
the contract, is not necessarily a requisite. For instance,
I may be liable for the negligent act of my son
in running my automobile in connection with my business,
although he is acting without any compensation.
There are four methods by which the relationship of
agency arises: (1) By contract; (2) by ratification;
(3) by estoppel; (4) by necessity.</p>

<p>WHO IS OR MAY BE AN AGENT.&mdash;The law
of agency, as between principal and agent, is simply
an application of the general law of contracts, but as
between third parties and the principal, or agent, new
questions arise. The first question is, who is an agent
and who is a principal? Any employer is a principal
and any employee is an agent. The employer is a principal
whether he employs the employee for a single
act or whether he employs him for a period of time.
Besides the ordinary cases that you will think of under
the head of employer and employee, an officer of a
corporation is an agent, the corporation being the
principal. The president of a corporation is as much
an agent as a clerk in the employ of the corporation.
A partner is an agent&mdash;of the firm. These different
kinds of agents are distinguished chiefly in the different
scope of the authority which they possess.</p>

<p>DISABILITY.&mdash;In our discussion of contracts,
we found that certain persons were under disability
so far as making contracts was concerned. We mentioned
the case of infants, married women, insane persons,
and the like. The same disabilities do not exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
in the law of agency, so far as the agent is concerned.
Any person may act as an agent or servant. So infants,
married women, slaves, and even lunatics, may
be agents or servants whose acts will bind their principals.
It has been held that even a dog may be an
agent. As to who may be a principal, the ordinary
rules of contracts, as we have discussed them, may be
relied upon as giving the correct rule.</p>

<p>AGENCY BY CONTRACT.&mdash;Concerning
agency which arises by contract, little need be said.
A contract of agency must possess all of the elements
of the ordinary contract, such as mutual assent, consideration,
competent parties, legality of object, and
in some cases, a particular form. The general principles
of contract law as we have discussed them are
applicable to this method of forming the agency relationship.</p>

<p>POWERS OF ATTORNEY.&mdash;In connection
with the formation of agency by contract, special attention
must be given to powers of attorney. A power
of attorney must oftentimes be given in order to convince
third persons that the agent really is an agent,
with the powers which he claims to possess. A power
of attorney is nothing more than a written statement
that a particular person is the agent of another person,
with the powers stated in the document. A power
of attorney may be very broad, giving the agent very
wide powers, or may be narrow, giving the agent or
attorney power to do only a specific thing. Now,
many powers, so far as the law itself is concerned,
might just as well be oral as written, but you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
not induce third parties to deal with the agent and
believe that he had authority unless he showed as
proof of it a power of attorney. That is why a power
of attorney is generally given; not that the law requires
it, but that the agent may have evidence of his
agency which will satisfy third persons that he is
really the agent. A corporation would not transfer
stock without a written power presented to it; yet, if
it chooses to run the risk, there would be nothing illegal
in doing so. But it does not choose, and an attempt
to compel it to transfer would be held unreasonable
unless the authority of the person claiming
to be empowered to transfer the stock were in writing
and shown to it.</p>

<p>WITNESSED AND SEALED POWERS OF
ATTORNEY.&mdash;A witness is not necessary on a
power of attorney. A witness on a power of attorney
has the same effect as on any other document where
a witness is not absolutely required, and that is this:
if the signature of a document is called in question
and the signature is witnessed, the way which the
law requires proof of the signature is by calling the
witness to testify, and no other evidence is permissible
until the witness is produced or his absence accounted
for; that is, some adequate reason given and
proved for not producing the particular man who
witnessed the signature. For this very reason it is
sometimes more difficult to prove a signature which
is witnessed than one which is not. A signature which
is not witnessed may be proved by anybody who has
seen the person sign, or who is familiar with his signature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and who can testify that the signature in question
is his. The object of a witness is to provide certain
evidence that a signature is genuine. The testimony
of a witness may be more convincing in case of
a dispute than testimony of one who merely recognizes
the signer's handwriting. A witnessed power
of attorney might be, however, more difficult to prove
if the power of attorney were contested than if it was
not witnessed, that is, if the witness could not be
found. On the other hand, if you had your witness
within reach it would be easy to prove the signature
by him. The whole matter of witnesses to deeds and
other documents, where a witness is not absolutely
required, may be thus summarized: it is a good thing
to have a witness if the witness is a reliable, well-known
person who can always or generally be
reached. It is a bad thing to have a witness who is a
servant or a person whom you may lose sight of after
some time has elapsed. The question may also be
asked: How does a power of attorney, when given
under seal, compare with one without a seal? One is
as good as the other, except that if it is desired that
the attorney or agent shall execute any instrument
under seal, such as a deed of real estate, the power
must itself be under seal; but a power to do anything
which does not require the execution of a sealed instrument
is just as good without a seal as with one.
This, however, is true; if the power contains an agreement
by the principal not to revoke the power, this
agreement will not be binding if there is neither seal
nor consideration, but will be binding without consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
if under seal, in a State where seals still have
their common-law effect. The principal will be able,
it is true, even in such a case, to revoke the power,
but he will commit a breach of contract if he does.</p>

<p>AGENCY BY RATIFICATION.&mdash;Where the
assent of the principal to the act of the agent is given
after the act is performed, it is in the nature of a ratification
of the act, and is intended to clothe the act
with the same qualities as if there had been a previous
authority or appointment. Suppose, for example, A
and B are acquaintances. Both are wealthy. A is a
good judge of horses and knows B likes good horses.
A discovers what he considers a good horse and buys
it for B at a very low price. He tells B the next day
what he has done and B goes to get the horse and
tenders the price, but the dealer refuses to sell, as he
has been offered a higher price. B has a cause of
action for breach of contract, for by ratifying A's act,
he has made a binding contract between himself and
the dealer. Suppose in the same illustration, A had
selected two horses for B, but when B saw them he
decided to take only one of them. In that case, there
would be no contract, for it is fundamental that a
ratification, to be effective, must be of the whole contract,
and not of a part. A ratification, once it is given,
dates back to the original transaction and is irrevocable.</p>

<p>FORMATION OF AGENCY BY ESTOPPEL.&mdash;An
estoppel may be said to arise where a person
does some act which will preclude him from averring
anything to the contrary. So, if one holds out another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
as his agent, he is estopped to repudiate the acts of such
a person within the scope of his ostensible authority.
In the case of Bradish v. Belknap, 41 Vt. 172, the facts
were that for a long time prior to 1863, B was the
agent of the defendants in selling stoves. This fact
was generally known and was well known to the plaintiff.
In 1863 B ceased to be the agent of the defendant,
but continued to sell stoves, which he purchased of
the defendants. No public notice of the termination
of the agency was given, nor was the fact known to
the plaintiff. B continued to represent himself as
agent of the defendants and was in the habit of taking
notes for stoves sold, payable to the defendants, and
this was known to the defendants. The plaintiff, believing
B to be the agent of the defendant, offered to
buy a stove of him and pay him in pine lumber. To
this B assented and the lumber was accordingly furnished
to B and the defendants, together with other
lumber which the plaintiff charged up to the defendants.
The defendants later attempted to escape liability
for the lumber furnished in excess of the value
of the stove. The court, holding them liable, said:
"B during all this time was perfectly poor and irresponsible,
and this fact was known by both parties.
B represented himself as the agent of the defendants,
and the conduct of the defendants was such as to justify
the plaintiff in regarding them as the principals;
and we can hardly conceive it possible under the circumstances
that the defendants did not understand
that the plaintiff so regarded them. And to allow
them now to deny the agency and thus defeat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
plaintiff's right to recover for the balance of the lumber
would be permitting them to perpetrate a palpable
fraud on the plaintiff."</p>

<p>ESTOPPEL DEFINED.&mdash;This term will occur
several times in the different topics of commercial law.
An estoppel may be said to arise when a party by conduct
or language has caused another reasonably to
believe in the existence of a certain state of things and
the other party acts on that belief, the first party is
precluded from denying the existence of that state of
things to any one who has justifiably relied on his
language or conduct.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;There is a common saying
in admiralty, that a seaman's claim for wages is nailed
to the last plank of the vessel. So if boatswain John
Silver is left unpaid by his vessel in London and he
later finds the vessel in New York, although its ownership
has entirely changed meanwhile, he may still
file a libel for his wages and have the United States
Marshal for the Southern District of New York seize
the vessel. Suppose however you contemplate buying
a vessel. You go on board with the present owner
and while all the members of the crew are lined up on
the main deck, you ask him in a voice loud enough to
be heard by everybody whether there are any unpaid
wage claims. He replies that everything is paid to
date. The crew remain silent. You purchase the
vessel and a few weeks later members of this same
crew seek to collect from the vessel a wage claim of
one year's standing. Their claims against the vessel
or against you as owner are unenforcable. In other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
words, they are estopped because of their conduct
when you purchased the vessel. If a person does not
speak when he ought, at times the law will not allow
him to speak when he wishes. Boatswain Silver had
never done anything to preclude him from asserting
his wage claim. His, therefore, is not a case of estoppel.</p>

<p>AGENCY BY NECESSITY.&mdash;The authority of
the agent may be enlarged by some particular necessity
or sudden emergency in which case it is the duty
of the agent to act, even though he cannot receive
the advice or directions of his principal. This method
of creating the agency relationship is one upon which
the courts are not agreed, and there is great conflict
in the decisions. The case of Gwilliam v. Twist,
(1895) 1 Q. B. 557, and 2 Q. B. 84, is a good illustration
of how close the line may be drawn. The facts
were that the driver of an omnibus belonging to defendants
became intoxicated while on duty and was
taken from his seat by a policeman. A man who happened
to be standing near volunteered to drive the
omnibus to the defendant's yard, and the driver and
conductor acquiesced, the former warning him to
drive carefully. The volunteer in negligently turning
a corner ran over and injured the plaintiff, who
brought action for damages against the defendants,
owners of the omnibus. The trial court held, with
considerable hesitation, that the defendants were
liable for the injury, placing its decision upon the
ground of agency by necessity; but the court of appeal
reversed the decision on the ground that the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
did not sufficiently appear, since the defendants
might have been communicated with, and left open
the question whether, if there had been an actual necessity,
the defendants would have been liable.</p>

<p>RIGHT OF PRINCIPAL TO DILIGENT
AND SKILLFUL SERVICE.&mdash;Let us consider, first,
the rights of the principal and agent as between one
another. The rights which the principal has against
the agent are, first, a right to have the employee render
reasonably diligent and skillful service. The
amount of skill which the employer can fairly demand
from his agent depends on the character of the contract
between the two and on the circumstances justifying
the principal in expecting a greater or less
degree of skill. When a man employs an expert
accountant to act for him he has a right to expect
greater skill than if he were employing an ordinary
bookkeeper. It depends on the character of the work
and of the man employed. The amount of compensation
paid to the employee may also have a bearing
on the amount of skill the employer has a right to
expect.</p>

<p>RIGHT OF PRINCIPAL THAT AGENT
SHALL NOT EXCEED HIS AUTHORITY.&mdash;The
second right that a principal has is to demand from
his agent that the agent shall act in obedience to
instructions and only within the limits of his authority.
These limits may be fixed expressly in the contract
between principal and agent, or they may be
left wholly to implication from the nature of the employment.
Perhaps more commonly they are partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
fixed by express agreement and partly fixed by natural
implications which arise from the nature of the
employment.</p>

<p>RIGHT OF PRINCIPAL TO ACCOUNTING.&mdash;Thirdly,
the principal has a right in financial dealings
with his agent, or in regard to financial dealings
of the agent with third persons, to demand an account
from his agent. It is not enough that the agent actually
expend money intrusted to him correctly; he
must furnish a correct account of expenses and of
collections.</p>

<p>RIGHT OF PRINCIPAL TO FIDELITY.&mdash;Finally,
the agent is under a duty of fidelity or loyalty
to his principal. The principal is entitled to demand
that the agent, unless the contrary is agreed,
shall make the employment or agency his sole interest
in regard to that particular thing. Of course, in many
agencies the agent is undertaking a great deal of
outside business besides the particular agency in
question, and he has a right so to do so long as the
principal has not engaged his whole time, and so long
as one agency does not interfere with another. But
that last is an important point. An agent who undertakes
one task for one principal which occupies only
one-tenth of his time cannot take another employment
which is inconsistent with that. An agent to
sell a particular kind of goods for one principal, even
though his agency is not expected to take the agent's
whole time, cannot undertake an agency for a competing
principal. The two things are inconsistent,
and the agent would be disloyal if he accepted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>SIDE COMPENSATION.&mdash;Then, again, the
agent must not get what may be called "side compensation"
of any sort. His whole compensation as
agent must be what is due him directly from the principal
under the agreement. For instance, if a buyer
for a department store gets paid a commission by a
firm from which he buys goods, that is a side commission
which the buyer as an agent has no right to
take; and so strict is the law, that if an agent does
take any such extra compensation the principal has
a right to recover it from him. Of course, if the principal
agrees to side compensation, it is all right for
the agent to take it; when the principal agrees to it,
it ceases to be what we have called side compensation
and becomes part of the agent's direct compensation
to which he is entitled under his bargain with his
principal.</p>

<p>ACTING AS AGENT FOR BOTH PARTIES.&mdash;One
of the most common difficulties that agents get
into in regard to this requirement of fidelity, and
sometimes with entirely good faith, is undertaking
to act as agent for both parties. That cannot be
done unless each party especially agrees that the
agent may act for the adverse party. An attorney-at-law
cannot represent two sides of a case. A real estate
broker cannot represent buyer and seller, and a stock
broker cannot represent buyer and seller. Stock brokers
have one practice which perhaps may seem to
infringe this rule. A customer comes into a broker's
office and says he wants to buy 100 shares of New
York Central. About the same time another customer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
comes in and says he wants to sell 100 shares
of New York Central. Now, must a broker go on the
exchange and make a purchase for one customer and
then a sale for the other, or may he, so to speak, negotiate
through himself a sale for the customer who
wants to buy from the one who wants to sell? What
he frequently does, in fact, is this: He buys and sells
from himself, but publicly, giving other brokers the
chance to buy or sell if they wish. The broker, according
to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange,
cannot execute this transaction secretly in his office,
but must offer the securities in question on the exchange,
and the purchase and sale must be recorded
on the ticker. If the bidding and asking prices are
more than an eighth apart, he may offer the New
York Central at a price midway between the bidding
and asking quotations and buy it himself and charge
each customer a commission, but he must actually
make the offer or bid aloud on the floor. The broker
is technically acting for both parties, but he is not
fixing the price. He makes an open bid on the exchange,
and it may be that would save the transaction.</p>

<p>AGENT'S RIGHT TO COMPENSATION.&mdash;What
are the rights of the agent against the principal?
They are two. First, a right to compensation;
that is, a right to the pay that has been agreed upon,
or, if no pay was agreed upon but it was understood
that there should be some compensation, then a right
to reasonable compensation. It is perfectly possible
to have an agency without compensation. Frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
one man agrees to act for another without pay, and
an agent who is acting without compensation, so long
as he acts as agent, is bound to the same obligations
to his principal as if he were receiving compensation,
only he can withdraw from his agency whenever he
sees fit since he is not paid for it. But unless circumstances
show that an agency was understood to be
without compensation, it would be implied that reasonable
compensation was to be paid to the agent for
his services.</p>

<p>AGENT'S RIGHT TO REIMBURSEMENT.&mdash;The
other right of the agent is the right to reimbursement
and indemnity. As the agent is acting for the
principal, the principal ought to pay all the bills of
whatever kind incurred, so long as the agent is acting
rightfully within his authority, and the principal is
bound to pay all such bills. This obligation of the
principal to pay all the bills of the agency means not
simply that he must pay actual expenses, but that if
liabilities of any kind arise by reason of third persons
suing the agent or holding him liable, if the action of
the agent was within his authority, the principal must
indemnify against any loss.</p>

<p>PRINCIPAL BOUND TO THIRD PERSONS
BY AUTHORIZED ACTS OF AGENT.&mdash;Now
let us turn from the rights of principal and agent as between
one another to the rights of third persons.
When do third persons get rights against the principal?
In the first place, whenever the agent, acting
in accordance with his authority, enters into a transaction
with a third person on behalf of the principal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the principal is bound to the third person to just the
same extent as if he himself had entered into the
transaction; but it is not only in cases where express
authority is given to the agent that this principle applies.</p>

<p>IMPLIED AUTHORITY OF AGENT.&mdash;In
many cases the authority given an agent is not expressly
stated. One has to rely on the general course
of business and on the nature of the employment to
determine the extent of the agent's authority. A third
person deals with a cashier of a bank, or deals with
the paying teller, or he deals with the president; now
whether the bank is bound by that dealing depends
on what is by general custom, or course of business,
the authority of a cashier or a paying teller or a president.
If cashiers or paying tellers or presidents generally
have certain authority, then it is a fair assumption
that this particular officer has such authority.</p>

<p>AUTHORITY TO DO PARTICULAR ACTS.&mdash;An
agent to sell has generally no authority to make
a sale on credit or to receive anything but money; he
cannot barter or exchange the property even in part,
nor pledge or dispose of the property to be sold in
payment of his own debts. For the sale of land an
agent's authority ought always to be under seal, and
the provisions contained in this power of attorney
will be strictly construed. In a sale of personal property,
an agent has implied authority to do whatever
is usual and necessary in such transactions. He may
receive payment if he has possession of the goods, but
not otherwise, and warrant the quality, if such goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
are customarily sold with a warranty by agents. He
cannot sell on credit unless such is the custom, as in
the case of commission merchants, nor pledge or
mortgage the goods. The agent may not buy on credit
unless so authorized, or it is the custom of the trade;
but a principal's direction to purchase, without supplying
the agent with funds, will imply authority to
purchase on credit. The agent must purchase precisely
as directed. An agent to manage has an authority
co-extensive in scope with the business, and
possesses the same power and authority as the principal,
so far as management goes, but the agent may
not sell or dispose of a business, nor mortgage the property
used in carrying it on, nor engage in new and
different enterprises. Public agents, i. e., public
officers, cannot involve their principals, the municipal
corporations whose officers they are, in contract liabilities
with third parties unless actually authorized
to do the act in question; and all persons dealing with
them must inform themselves of the scope of their
legal powers.</p>

<p>APPARENT AUTHORITY OF AGENT.&mdash;But
it is not only in cases where the agent is expressly
authorized, or authorized by such implication as we
have just alluded to, that the principal is bound.
There is the further case where the agent has apparent
authority, although, as a matter of fact, he has
no authority. Take the case of a cashier certifying a
check. We will suppose that cashiers, generally, have
authority to certify checks. With most cashiers that
would be what we have called an implied authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
as it arises from the general nature of their positions
though nothing was ever said about it by the bank
directors. But suppose in a particular bank it was a
rule of the bank, expressly stated and voted by the
directors, that the cashier should not have power
to certify checks. Now, no one can say that his power
here is either express or implied; it is certainly not
express, and any implication that might otherwise
arise from his position is negatived by the express
vote of the directors, and yet if that cashier should
certify a check to any person ignorant of this limitation
on his authority the bank would be bound by the
certification because the cashier has apparent authority.
He looks to the world as if he had authority,
and seems to the public like any other cashier. Most
of the difficult cases in agency, so far as liability of
the principal to third persons is concerned, relate to
this matter of apparent authority.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS.&mdash;Compare the following
case with the case of the cashier above alluded to: A
man who is giving some support financially to a book
dealer writes a note in which he says, "I authorize A
B to buy a stock of books not exceeding, at any one
time, $5,000." The book dealer shows that written
authority to persons from whom he wishes to buy
books. They sell him books, and, unknown to the last
person who thus sells him books, he has just before
bought a quantity which makes the total largely exceed
$5,000. Is the principal liable to the persons who
last sold books to the dealer? The answer is no. And
what is the difference between that case and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
cashier case? In the book case the last seller saw the
paper giving authority to the book dealer to purchase.
He had no reason to know that the day before a large
quantity of books had been purchased. He acted in
entire good faith and the deception was natural. Still,
the employer, or the writer of the letter, has done
nothing here to make the last seller suppose that
$5,000 worth of books had not already been bought,
nor does the course of business justify the last seller in
supposing they might not already have been bought.
It was a hard question for him to find out, but on
the face of the letter it was evident that any one who
dealt with the bookseller might have to determine this
question or rely at his peril on the bookseller's word.
Here is another case: a town treasurer was authorized
to borrow a certain sum of money. He gets a certified
copy of the vote and goes to one bank and borrows
the money, and goes to another bank with
that same certified copy of the vote and borrows the
money over again. Is the town liable to the second
bank? No; on the face of the paper there was but
one loan to the town authorized, and any one who
lends the money must at his peril find out whether a
loan has already been made. When we say, therefore,
that a principal is bound if his agent had apparent
authority, we do not mean that whenever a third person
is deceived into the belief that the agent has
authority, the principal is bound. Quite to the contrary,
the principal must have in some way been the
cause of that deception; he must have caused it either
by some express representations, or he must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
caused it by putting a man in a place where the general
course of business would induce the public to
believe the agent had greater powers than he had.</p>

<p>GENERAL AND SPECIAL AGENTS.&mdash;It is
much easier to find a case of apparent authority, which
will bind the principal, if the agent is a general agent
than if he is a special agent. A special agent is an
agent authorized to do one act, as this town treasurer
was authorized to make one loan. The cashier is a
general agent, authorized to do any of the great
variety of acts which cashiers ordinarily do, and if the
directors vote to take away one of the normal powers
of the cashier, they must make the limitation public or
the bank will be bound by the cashier's act.</p>

<p>UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPAL.&mdash;Not only may
the third person hold the principal liable in cases
where the agent purports to act for the principal,
but also in cases where the agent does not disclose his
principal at all and purports to act as a principal himself,
so long as it is true that the agent really was
acting in the principal's business. Suppose a selling
agent for a manufactory enters into a contract for the
sale of goods produced in the manufactory. The selling
agent, we will further suppose, contracts&mdash;as selling
agents often do&mdash;in his own name; but he contracts
in regard to the sale of the product of the principal,
the manufacturer, and on his behalf. Now,
assume that this contract of the sales agent was authorized;
the third person may sue the manufacturing
company, though he did not know of the existence of
the manufactory at the time he entered into the contract,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and supposed he was contracting simply with
the agent. As it is phrased in law, an undisclosed
principal is liable, and conversely, the undisclosed
principal may sue on this contract made by the sales
agent.</p>

<p>RATIFICATION.&mdash;If an agent acts beyond his
authority, the principal, if he chooses, may ratify the
acts of the agent. Occasionally in an emergency it
becomes necessary for an agent who has his principal's
interest at heart to take a chance and act beyond the
authority given him. In such a case, if the principal
ratifies it, it is all right, both as far as the agent is
concerned, and as far as the third person is concerned;
but, of course, the principal is under no legal obligation
to ratify.</p>

<p>RIGHTS OF PRINCIPAL AGAINST THIRD
PERSONS.&mdash;Now, the right of the principal against
the third person is the converse of the right of the
third person against the principal, of which we have
been speaking. Generally when a transaction is of such
a sort that the third person would have a right of action
against the principal, if the principal fails to do as
he agreed, the principal will have a right of action
against the third person if the latter breaks his agreement.</p>

<p>PRINCIPAL IS LIABLE FOR TORTS OF
AGENT.&mdash;Not only is the principal liable for the contracts
of his agent, but he is also liable for any tort
which an agent may commit, so long as he is acting in
the course of his business. Of course, accident cases
present the commonest type of that sort of liability.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
A street railway is liable for the results of its motor-man's
neglect, so long as the motorman was running
the car. If the motorman got off the car on a frolic of
his own, the street railway would not be liable for anything
he might do then. The same principle may be
found in other cases than accident cases. Suppose
officers of a corporation wrongfully overissue stock.
If those officers were the officers authorized to issue
stock, and, therefore, were acting in the general
course of their business, the corporation would be
liable for that tortious act in overissuing stock.</p>

<p>AUTHORITY MAY GENERALLY BE ORAL
AS WELL AS WRITTEN.&mdash;The authority given
by a principal to an agent may in general be oral as
well as written; it is just as good. There are, however,
a few exceptions to that. In the first place, an
authority given to an agent to execute an instrument
under seal must itself be not only written but under
seal. An oral or a written authority, if not under
seal, given to an agent to convey land, which must
be conveyed by a sealed deed, would not enable
the agent to make a valid deed. Where the effect
of seals is abolished this principle is of course no
longer applicable. Generally an agent orally authorized
to make a contract to buy or sell land may
bind his principal by entering into such a contract.
The contract the agent enters into, must, because of
the Statute of Frauds, be in writing, and signed, but
the agent's authority generally need not be written.
In some States, however, written authority is required
by statutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>PROXIES.&mdash;A proxy is simply a written power
of attorney to an agent, authorizing him to vote for a
stockholder, and there, too, a corporation would be
held justified in refusing to recognize any proxy that
was not in writing, or any agent who did not have a
written proxy even though proxies were not required
to be in writing.</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF AGENT TO THIRD PERSONS.&mdash;How
about the rights and duties of the
agent as against the outside world? The agent is
liable to a third person if he commits a tort. It does
not make any difference that the principal is also
liable, the agent is liable too. The third person may
sue either the principal or agent as he prefers; he
cannot get compensation for his injury more than
once, but he can get that either from the principal
or agent, whichever is more convenient. The third
person may hold the agent liable if the agent contracts
for an undisclosed principal. In the case of the
sales agent referred to a moment ago, where the agent
was really acting as agent for a manufacturer but did
not say so, the third person might sue the manufacturer
on the contract; but he might sue the agent, and
if the agent was held liable the agent would have to
seek reimbursement from the principal.</p>

<p>AGENT WARRANTS HIS AUTHORITY.&mdash;An
agent is liable in one other case to the third person
with whom he deals. If the agent did not have
authority to do what he purported to do, the third person
can sue him, though the third person could not
sue the principal in this case, since the agent was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
exceeding his authority. An agent is said to warrant
his authority to third persons with whom he does
business.</p>

<p>AGENT CANNOT DELEGATE AUTHORITY.&mdash;An
important rule in agency is that an agent
cannot delegate his authority. If A is appointed to
do certain work, A must do it himself, and cannot
empower B to do it if it proves inconvenient to do
it himself. There are three exceptions to this rule.
The first is that if he is given express permission to
delegate his authority, he may do so, and, of course,
if the principal should ratify an unpermitted delegation
of authority, the ratification would here, as always,
serve as well as original authority. The second
case is where the usage of business is such that the
principal must be presumed to have understood that
there was to be a delegation, or partial delegation,
of authority, and in such a case, though the principal
has not expressly authorized delegation, he will be
treated as if he had authorized it by virtue of business
usage. The third case where delegation is authorized
is in regard to what are called ministerial or
mechanical acts, that is, acts which involve no exercise
of judgment or skill. The principal is entitled to
the agent's judgment and skill, but if there are parts
of the work that do not require skill and that, from
their nature, any ordinary clerical assistant can do,
then such acts may be delegated.</p>

<p>TERMINATION OF AGENCY BY ACT OF
PARTIES.&mdash;The parties may have agreed in their
contract that it should terminate at a certain time or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
on the happening of a certain event. The arrival of
that time or the happening of the event would of
course end the relation as between them. It would
not so operate as between principal and third parties,
however, unless the third parties were informed. So,
performance of the purpose for which the relation
was created terminates the relation as between principal
and agent. The parties may make a subsequent
agreement to terminate the relation, and such an
agreement would be good, the abandonment of the
rights of each party created by the original contract
being a sufficient consideration for the promise of
each to surrender his own rights.</p>

<p>REVOCATION.&mdash;Except in the case of irrevocable
agency noted below, the principal may revoke at
any time the agent's authority as to matters not already
executed. Any other rule would enslave the
principal to his agent by forcing him, at the agent's
will, and against his own consent, into contracts with
third parties. But, while the principal has this right,
the exercise of it may subject him to liability to his
agent. If the contract of employment is for a definite
time, and the principal, without cause, revokes the
agent's authority before that time arrives, the principal
is liable to the agent for breach of contract; if
no time is fixed for the termination of the agency, it is
an agency at will, and the principal, with or without
cause, may revoke at any time without incurring
liability to his agent. The acts which will amount to
a revocation by the principal are various. For instance,
if an agent has exclusive authority to represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the principal, the appointment of another agent
would amount to a revocation. As to making the
revocation effective, a revocation operates on the
agent from the time he has notice of it. It is effective
as to third parties only when notice is given to those
who have dealt with the agent that the agent's authority
is revoked. Without such notice the principal
does not escape liability to third persons by
reason of further acts on his agent's part. Where an
agent is appointed in a particular business, parties
dealing with him in that business have a right to rely
upon the continuance of his authority until in some
way informed of its revocation. This notice must be
actual to those who have dealt with the agent, and
general, as by publication in newspapers, where persons
have not before dealt with the agent.</p>

<p>RENUNCIATION.&mdash;The agent may renounce
his employment at any time, but if he contracted to
serve for a certain time, and renounce before that time
arrives, he is liable to the principal for breach of contract,
unless he has ground for renunciation, such as
the principal's breach of faith with him. The sickness
of the agent is a ground for renouncing the relation,
even though the sickness be caused by his own
negligence or wrong. The principal should inform
third persons of the agent's renunciation if he would
fully protect himself against further acts of the agent.</p>

<p>TERMINATION OF AGENCY BY OPERATION
OF LAW.&mdash;As in the case of ordinary contracts,
a contract of agency may be terminated by the
rules of law upon the happening of certain events.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Thus, the destruction of the subject-matter of the
agency terminates the relation, if the parties contemplated
the continued existence of the subject-matter as
the foundation for what was to be done. A change in
the law, as the enactment of a statute declaring illegal
agencies of a certain nature, that previously had been
legal, terminates the relation. So also certain changes
affecting the parties to the relation&mdash;i. e., the principal
or the agent&mdash;effect a termination. The death
of the principal brings the relation to an end, and this
is so although the agent had no notice of it and subsequently
dealt on behalf of his principal with third
persons; such contracts do not bind the principal's
estate. The death of the agent necessarily ends the
relation. The occurrence of the principal's insanity
terminates the relation, and a judicial finding of insanity
is notice to all; but without notice of the insanity
third persons who deal with the agent in good
faith are protected. The bankruptcy of the principal
terminates the relation as to all matters affected by
the bankruptcy. Impossibility to continue the relation
brought about by restraint of law terminates the
relation.</p>

<p>IRREVOCABLE AGENCIES.&mdash;An agency to
do an act touching a thing in which the agent has an
interest, or in which he is subject to an obligation,
cannot be terminated by act of the principal alone.
The principal cannot terminate the relation so as to
leave the agent under obligations to third persons,
thereby shifting his obligations upon the agent; nor
can he do so when the agent has an interest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
subject-matter of the agency. It is difficult to state
concisely what will constitute such an interest that
the principal cannot terminate the relation, but it
may be said to be some ownership or right in the
matter dealt with, such that the agent may deal with
it in his own name, and not a mere benefit to be
obtained from the performance of the contract of
agency, as a commission to be realized from sales.
Possession of personal property with the right to
sell, with authority to apply the proceeds to a debt
due from the principal to the agent, is sometimes held
to constitute an agency coupled with an interest such
that the principal may not revoke it; on the other
hand, an interest arising from commissions or the
proceeds of a transaction, is not an interest which
will prevent revocation. The courts carefully examine
agencies claimed to be irrevocable because
coupled with an interest, and are inclined to rule
against them.</p>

<p>MASTER AND SERVANT.&mdash;As we have said,
the function of the servant is to perform ministerial
or mechanical acts for the master. The chief subject-matter
under the law of principal and agent is contracts,
while the chief subject-matter of the law of
master and servant is tort. The servant, in performing
acts for his master, may, inadvertently or wilfully,
cause injury to a third person or to the property
of a third person. The question arises: What is
the master's responsibility? We shall consider this
from two standpoints; the relationship of the master
and servant, inter se (between themselves), and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
relationship of the master and servant as to the outside
world. For example: the driver of a delivery
truck, operated by Lord &amp; Taylor, negligently runs
over a pedestrian. The truck was going at the rate
of twenty-five miles an hour, although the instructions
issued by Lord &amp; Taylor to all their servants
is not to run cars more than fifteen miles per hour
in the congested parts of New York City. Is Lord
&amp; Taylor liable to the pedestrian? This question involves
the relationship of master and servant as to
outside parties. The same servant, while operating
the delivery truck for Lord &amp; Taylor is run into, negligently,
by a delivery truck operated by R. H. Macy
&amp; Co. Is the master, Lord &amp; Taylor, responsible to
its servant for the injury which he suffers as the result
of the collision? This question involves the relationship
of master and servant inter se. We shall consider
this latter relationship first.</p>

<p>THE COMMON LAW GOVERNING THE
RELATIONSHIP OF MASTER AND SERVANT
INTER SE.&mdash;What is the liability of the master towards
the servant if the servant is injured? We shall
see in the chapter on torts that a tort is defined to be
a breach of duty imposed by law for which a suit for
damages may be maintained. Hence it follows that
the master's liability in tort flows from a breach of
duty owed by him to his servant. If there is no legal
duty, correspondingly there is no legal liability.
These legal duties which the common law developed
over a long period of years may be summed up as
follows: (1) To provide a reasonably safe place for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the servant to work. (2) To provide reasonably safe,
suitable, and sufficient tools and appliances with
which the servant is to perform his work. (3) To
provide reasonably careful and competent fellow
workmen and in sufficient number for the work in
hand. (4) To warn the servant of any unusual dangers
connected with the work. (5) Generally so to
conduct the work as not to expose the servant to
dangers which could be avoided by the exercise of
reasonable diligence. From the servant's standpoint,
it was said that he assumed the ordinary risks inherent
to the kind of business in which he was employed.
These rules of the common law were the
outgrowth of conditions surrounding the small shop
and involving the use of simple or no machinery.
Under modern industrial conditions they have proved
wholly inadequate. We have been unduly conservative
in recognizing this. Strangely enough the Workmen's
Compensation Acts, with which we are now so
familiar, had their origin in Germany in 1884. Nearly
all the countries of continental Europe recognized the
situation about thirty years ago, and England in 1897,
and the United States within the last few years.</p>

<p>THE OBJECTION OF THE COMMON LAW
THEORY.&mdash;Under the old theory, if the master had
observed the duties which we have mentioned, he
had performed his whole obligation to his own servant;
thus, if two fellow workmen were working on
the twentieth story of a new steel skyscraper being
erected by the Institute Construction Co., and
through the carelessness of servant A, servant B was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
precipitated to the street and killed, there would be
no recovery on the part of the estate of the deceased
servant, although he may have left a wife and several
children dependent wholly upon him for support.
Even admitting that the Institute Construction Co.
had exercised due care in selecting competent fellow
servants for the deceased to work with, and had,
therefore, performed all of its obligations on this
score, nevertheless, it is better, from the standpoint of
society, that the wife and children of servant B should
receive fair compensation rather than be thrown upon
the mercy of the public. The great object of the
Workmen's Compensation Act is to shift the burden
of such economic waste from the employer to the industry,
in order that it may ultimately be borne by
the consumer as a part of the necessary cost of construction
and production. Thus we are asking the
master to assume a greater financial responsibility
for injuries to his servant under this new theory than
he has assumed heretofore. This can be taken care of
by the increased price he charges for his work and
this in turn will ultimately pass the added burden to
the community at large.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;Again, even if the servant
did have a cause of action against his master, because
of the master's failure to observe the common law requirements
we have mentioned, nevertheless, the expense
of litigation and the interminable delays connected
with it, amounting at times to two or three
years before the case was finally disposed of by the court
of last resort, all tended to make litigation for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
servant all but impossible. He would ordinarily have
no money with which to begin this long litigation,
and would be obliged to retain the services of a lawyer,
who would take the case on a contingent fee
basis, and often take from the workman, should the
decision finally be in his favor, a third, a half, or even
a greater portion of the amount that he recovers.
Perhaps this was no greater compensation than the
lawyer was entitled to because of the labor involved
and the prospect of no pay if he lost the case, but regardless
of this it was hard on the client. The
Supreme Court of Washington, in the case of Stertz
v. The Industrial Insurance Commission, 91 Wash.
588, has summed up the objections against the whole
system as follows: "Both had suffered under the old
system, the employers by heavy judgments of which
half was opposing lawyers' booty, the workmen
through the old defenses or exhaustion in wasteful
litigation. Both wanted peace. The master in exchange
for limited liability was willing to pay on
some claims in future where in the past there had
been no liability at all. The servant was willing not
only to give up trial by jury but to accept far less than
he had often won in court, provided he was sure to
get the small sum without having to fight for it....
To win only after litigation, to collect only after the
employment of lawyers, to receive the sum only after
months or years of delay, was to the comparatively
indigent claimant little better than to get nothing.
The workmen wanted a system entirely new. It is
but fair to admit that they had become impatient with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the courts of law. They knew, and both economists
and progressive jurists were pointing out, what is
now generally conceded, that two generations ought
never to have suffered from the baleful judgments of
Abinger and Shaw."</p>

<p>WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT.&mdash;To
meet the objections we have just mentioned, the
workmen's compensation act principle was developed
on the continent of Europe. Practically all of continental
Europe had placed laws of this character on
its statute books before the end of the nineteenth
century; in 1906 England passed similar legislation,
and within the last few years, we have adopted the
same principles. With the exception of a few Southern
States, every State and territory of the United States
has a Workmen's Compensation Act. We cannot
consider these acts in detail. The principle underlying
them is the same throughout the country. They
are designed to compensate servants for "accidents"
"arising out of," and "during the course of" their employment,
and this, regardless of whether the servant
was at fault or not. The whole theory of the common
law had been that the master must be at fault in order
that the servant may recover. The new theory is that
the community at large can better stand the loss suffered
by a servant than the individual servant. For
example: a steel girder falls upon a workman engaged
in structural steel work, through no fault on his part
and also through no fault on the part of his employer.
Under the common law, he would have to stand the
loss himself. Under the Workmen's Compensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Act, such an event is an "accident"; it "arose out of"
and "in the course of" his employment. Therefore,
he is entitled to a fixed compensation, and he secures
it almost immediately through a workmen's compensation
bureau, or whatever body the act of the particular
State creates for the purpose of settling such
matters. This is a burden on the employer, it is true;
he was in no way to blame. Neither was the workman.
The employer may protect himself against the
claims of his workmen by insurance under a plan provided
by the State law, or if the State law does not
provide for it, by arrangements with private companies
the same as any other accident insurance is obtained,
and by figuring his cost upon the particular
job, he can charge as a part of his operating expense,
the cost of his insurance and include that in his charge
for work. The loss suffered by the individual workmen
is then passed to the community at large. From
an economical and sociological standpoint, this situation
is undoubtedly better than that existing under
the theory of the common law.</p>

<p>THE INTERPRETATION OF WORKMEN'S
COMPENSATION ACTS.&mdash;Although these acts
are comparatively new in this country, there has been
a great amount of litigation, and it is not practical to
enter into a discussion of all the close questions which
are raised in interpreting such acts. A vast amount
of the litigation has been concerned with the interpretation
of the three expressions, common to almost
all the acts, "accident" "arising out of" and "during
the course of." While the courts have shown a broad-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
spirit in interpreting these expressions, it is
undoubtedly true that some decisions will suggest
further legislation in order to correct certain evils
which exist at the present time. For example, in defining
the term "accident," the leading English case
said: "The expression 'accident' is used in the public
and ordinary sense of the word, as denoting an unlooked-for
event which is not expected or designed."
And Judge Siebecker of Wisconsin says "accidental"
contemplates "an event not within one's foresight and
expectation, resulting in a mishap causing injury to
the employee," and Mr. Justice Pound of New York
says that the statute contemplates injuries "not expected
or designed by the workman himself." To
illustrate: A window-dresser is decorating the window
in Woolworth's. He swallows a pin. This is
an "accident" within the contemplation of the act,
and entitles him to recovery. Again, a workman is
employed in a white-lead factory. During his six
months period of service in the factory, he contracts
tuberculosis. This is not an "accident" because you
must be able to put your finger upon a definite time
when the unlooked-for event happened. This leads
us to the general statement that Workmen's Compensation
Acts in this country, as at present drawn,
do not generally cover occupational diseases. Separate
legislation is undoubtedly desirable to extend
the principle in such cases, for if it is sound that the
window-dresser in Woolworth's should recover, it
should be equally sound that the workman who contracted
tuberculosis should recover. Again, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
two expressions "arising out of," and "during the
course of" have caused much litigation. Perhaps the
most satisfactory statement about these expressions
is in the leading Massachusetts case, In re McNicol,
215 Mass. 497. Here the court says: "The injury
must both arise 'out of' and also be received 'in the
course of' the employment. Neither alone is enough.
It is not easy * * * to give a comprehensive definition
of these words. * * * An injury is received 'in
the course of' the employment when it comes while
the workman is doing the duty which he is employed
to perform. It 'arises out of' the employment, when
there is * * * a causal connection between the conditions
under which the work is required to be performed
and the resulting injury. * * * If the injury
can be seen * * * to have been contemplated by a
reasonable person familiar with the whole situation,
* * * then it arises 'out of' the employment. * * *
The causative danger must be peculiar to the work
and not common to the neighborhood. * * * It need
not have been foreseen or expected, but after the
event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk
connected with the employment, and to have flowed
from that source as a rational consequence." An illustration
will show how these phrases are applied.
The janitor of a building is alone in the building. An
old enemy who has not seen him for years, learns his
whereabouts, comes into the building, shoots him in
the leg, causing him to have it amputated. Is the master
liable? It is an "accident," and clearly it arose "during
the course of" employment, but did it arise "out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of" his employment? Manifestly not. The guilty
party would have shot the man had he met him in
Central Park, or any other place. It was purely personal
vengeance on his part which caused the act. The
night watchman in a bank is shot by a robber at night
in the bank, while on duty. May he recover from his
master? Clearly he can. It is an "accident." It arose
"during the course of" his employment, it arose "out
of" his employment also, because the robber would
not have shot him were he not in the bank as a watchman,
standing between the robber and the accomplishment
of his purpose, the securing of money from the
bank.</p>

<p>THE RELATIONSHIP OF MASTER AND
SERVANT AS RELATING TO OUTSIDE
PARTIES.&mdash;If the relationship of master and servant
exists, the question arises, is the master responsible
for the torts committed by his servant, resulting in
injury to third parties? It is, of course, essential that
the wrongdoer must be the defendant's servant. It
does not follow that a wrongdoer is the defendant's
servant simply because of a certain relationship, as
that of parent and child, husband and wife, or employer
and employee. Within the last few years, a
great number of automobile cases have been decided
by the courts, and they are commonly spoken of as the
"family automobile cases." To illustrate: I own a car
which is used by the various members of my family.
My son, while running the car, for his own pleasure,
negligently runs over some one. Am I responsible?
Granting the relationship of parent and child, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
would not constitute, per se (of itself), the relationship
of master and servant. The injured man would
have to show more than I have indicated in order to
entitle him to recover for my son's negligence. Were
members of my family in the car, being taken out for a
ride by my son, I would be liable. Again, my wife, in
discharging a servant, assaults her. Should the mere
fact of the relationship of husband and wife make me
liable on the theory of master and servant? Clearly
not. Again, I employ John Smith as my chauffeur. I
never operate my car on Sunday. John Smith, who
lives in the town adjoining mine, is moving, and asks
if he may borrow my car over Sunday to assist in the
moving operations. While using the car for that purpose,
he negligently runs over some one. Am I liable?
Clearly not, for, although the relationship of master
and servant exists between me and my servant at the
time he did the injury, he was not acting for me as a
servant. What is the rule to be applied to answer such
questions?</p>

<p>THE SERVANT MUST BE ENGAGED IN
HIS MASTER'S BUSINESS.&mdash;It is clear from the
foregoing that, in order to make the master liable, the
servant must be engaged in his master's business, and
he must be acting within the scope of his employment.
The New York case of Rounds v. The Delaware, etc.,
Railroad, 64 N. Y. 129, states the general rule: "For
the acts of the servant, within the general scope of
his employment, while engaged in his master's business,
and done with a view to the furtherance of that
business and the master's interest, the master will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
responsible whether the act be done negligently, wantonly,
or even wilfully." The Court of Errors and Appeals
of New Jersey recently said in Holler v. Sanford
Ross, 68 N. J. Law, 324: "The Supreme Court of Connecticut
states the rule applicable to this class of cases
about as clearly as it can be done, when it says: 'For
all acts done by a servant in obedience to the express
orders or direction of the master, or in the execution
of the master's business, within the scope of his employment,
and for acts in any sense warranted by the
express or implied authority conferred upon him, considering
the nature of the service required, the instructions
given and the circumstances under which the act
is done, the master is responsible; for acts which are
not within these conditions, the servant alone is responsible.'"</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF A PUBLIC AGENCY FOR
THE NEGLIGENT ACTS OF ITS AGENTS.&mdash;It
is an old saying that "the King can do no wrong."
This principle of the English common law we have
applied in this country, and the Federal Government
cannot be sued unless it gives its consent. While the
Court of Claims has been established, Congress has
generally provided that suits may be brought against
the Federal Government only in contract actions, and
not in tort actions, so that ordinarily, if a person is
injured through the negligence of an employee of the
Federal Government, he may not recover against that
Government. Thus, my only remedy in case of an
injury, received through the negligent operation of an
elevator in a post-office building owned by the Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
would be the passing of special legislation by
Congress compensating me. I would have no right to
sue the United States for such injury. The same general
principles are applied to the State governments.
In regard to cities, the rule may be generally stated to
be that a municipality is not liable for the negligence
of its servants in those departments operated by the
municipality in its governmental activities, as distinguished
from its administrative activities, in which
case it is liable. Thus, a city is not responsible for the
negligence of its policemen or its firemen, although
injury results from their negligence, these departments
being examples of governmental activities of
a municipality, while the city would be liable, generally,
for the negligence of the employees of its water
department, this being an illustration of its administrative
activities. It is also generally held that public
charities, such as hospitals, and the like, are not liable
for torts committed by their servants, provided they
have used reasonable care in the selection of their
servants.</p>

<p>INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.&mdash;A distinction
must be made between one whom we call an
independent contractor and a master. When A desires
a particular piece of work done, he has two
options as to doing it. He may either hire a workman
to do it, retaining control of the workman, and telling
him how he shall do it, or he may let the work by contract,
simply stipulating that it shall be done in accordance
with plans and specifications which his architect
has drawn up. He retains no control over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
contractor or over his method of work. His sole interest
here is to have the piece of work turned over
to him in its completed state. In the first case, we call
the workman a servant; in the second case, he is an
independent contractor. One who employs an independent
contractor is not liable for the negligent acts
of the contractor or his servants, except in a few special
cases. In Berg v. Parsons, 156 N. Y. 109, the
majority of the court states: "There are certain exceptional
cases where a person employing a contractor is
liable, which, briefly stated, are: Where the employer
personally interferes with the work, and the acts performed
by him occasion the injury; where the thing
contracted to be done is unlawful; where the acts performed
create a public nuisance; and where an employer
is bound by a statute to do a thing efficiently
and an injury results from its inefficiency." A few,
but not many courts, add to this list one further fact,
that the employer must use due care in the selection
of a competent independent contractor, otherwise he
is liable. This would seem eminently sound.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
Partnership</h2>


<p>RELATIONS ANALOGOUS TO PRINCIPAL
AND AGENT.&mdash;There are a few relations, in
the law, which are analogous to that of principal
and agent. The one which we shall take up now
is the relationship of a partner to a partnership, and
also to the outside world. We shall consider in a subsequent
chapter, the functions, duties and responsibilities
of trustees, executors, and administrators.</p>

<p>THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIP
LAW.&mdash;There is a very common impression that
partnership law is not as important now as formerly.
This undoubtedly is true, as more and more large
business enterprises are being conducted in the corporation
form; but there is still a large amount of
business done in the partnership form. What is
most important, however, is the very informality
of the type of business conducted under
the partnership arrangement. Whether, in a given
case, a partnership exists, becomes a vital question.
Two friends, A and B, in an informal way,
go into a business venture. The enterprise fails and
A and B owe many debts. A has some property of
his own; B has nothing. You are a creditor, but all
your dealings have been with B. One simple point
will show you whether your claim is worthless. If
A and B were partners, you may hold A. If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
were not partners, your claim probably never will be
worth anything to you. The question, then, whether
or not a certain relationship constitutes a partnership
is a most important one, in the field of commercial
law.</p>

<p>PARTNERSHIP DEFINED.&mdash;We shall have
occasion, in the chapters on bills and notes, and personal
property, to refer to the movement to codify
certain branches of the law. This movement was
begun by the Commissioners on Uniform Laws proposing
the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Act,
which has now been adopted in all of the States except
Georgia. One of the most recent codifications is the
Uniform Partnership Act which has been adopted in
a number of the States, and which will undoubtedly
follow the same course as the other acts drawn by the
same Commissioners. We shall make frequent reference
to the Uniform Partnership Act in this chapter.
Although some of the writers on the law of partnership
state that no satisfactory definition of the term
partnership can be given, the Uniform Act defines it
as follows: "A partnership is an association of two
or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business
for profit." It is undoubtedly true that even with
this definition, a considerable amount of further explanation
will be necessary to determine with any degree
of certainty, just what is meant by partnership.</p>

<p>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PARTNERSHIP
AND A CORPORATION.&mdash;While we
may be anticipating our chapter on corporations, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
is well, at the very outset, to understand the fundamental
differences between a partnership and a corporation.
We may mention six differences:</p>

<p>(1) When a partner dies, the partnership is automatically
dissolved. If a partner sells or transfers
his interest in the business, this works a dissolution
of the firm. On the other hand, the situation is precisely
the opposite in the case of a corporation. The
death of a shareholder has no effect upon the corporation.
In fact, if all of the shareholders of the
United States Steel Corporation should die at once,
the corporation would still exist. So also the transfer
of stock from one owner to another has no effect upon
the corporation's existence. Many thousand shares
are dealt with on the exchange each day without the
slightest effect upon any corporation.</p>

<p>(2) The doctrine of individual liability for the
debts of a firm is a fundamental characteristic of
partnership law. Each member of the firm is absolutely
liable for all the debts of the firm. Thus, if
the firm consists of A, B, and C, and the firm goes
into bankruptcy and owes $50,000, and B and C are
both individually worthless, and A has his own private
fortune, A will be obliged to pay all of the debts,
although, according to the arrangements that the
partners made when forming the partnership, each
was to share the profits and losses equally. Theoretically,
A has the right to contribution from his fellow
partners, and should they later acquire property, he
will be able to enforce this right in a court of equity.
In a corporation, a shareholder is liable only for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
value of his share. If he subscribes to a share of stock,
par value $100, and has paid only $50 on his subscription,
and the corporation goes into bankruptcy,
its receiver can compel him to pay the balance of his
subscription, $50, but that would be the extent of
his loss. If I buy a share of United States Steel
Common, at $79, on the exchange, and the company
goes into bankruptcy, my loss will be only $79. I
would not be obliged to make up to the receiver the
other twenty-one dollars. The only noteworthy exception
to this rule as to the liability of a stockholder
is in the case of a shareholder in a National bank,
(this is true of some of the State banking laws also),
where a shareholder is liable to an extra assessment
equal to the par value of the stock he owns.</p>

<p>(3) In a partnership each member of the firm is
a general agent for the partnership, and his acts bind
the firm. In the case of a corporation, a shareholder,
by virtue of the fact that he is a shareholder, has no
power to bind the corporation. The position of a
shareholder is very similar to that of a voter. The
corporation is run by its board of directors. They
are elected by the shareholders just as we elect a
governor or president. If we are dissatisfied with
the conduct of a governor or president, all we can do
is to vote him out of office at the next election, except
in unusual cases where a governor or president might
be impeached. The same is true in the case of a
board of directors.</p>

<p>(4) A partnership may be created by a formal
contract, or a simple contract, in writing or by word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of mouth; in fact it may be created in almost any way.
A corporation, in order to do business, must comply
with the corporation laws of the State in which it is
incorporated. A regular formality must be observed.
A certificate of incorporation must be filed, generally
with the Secretary of State, and with the county clerk
of the county in which the corporation's principal
place of business is located in the State.</p>

<p>(5) A partnership may do anything that is legal
and which the members decide to do. A corporation
exists by virtue of a charter, granted by the State.
The sum total of the powers given in that charter
gives the total of all of the activities the corporation
may undertake. Engagement in activities not authorized
in the charter may result in the forfeiture of the
charter by the State.</p>

<p>(6) In legal theory, a corporation is looked upon
as a separate entity. Most States require at least
three persons to incorporate. A, B and C form a
corporation under the laws of the State of New York.
There are then four legal persons in existence: A, B,
and C, and this separate person, or legal entity, the
Green Corporation, if that is the name given the company.
In the case of a partnership, the law does not,
as a rule, consider the partnership as an entity distinct
and separate from the members who make up
the firm. Of course, the business man does, in a way,
look upon the partnership as a separate commercial
entity. The very fact that the members of the firm
are all general agents for the firm, and that the members
are individually liable for all of the debts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
firm, shows that the law does not carry the entity
theory into practice in partnerships as it does in corporations.</p>

<p>DIFFERENT KINDS OF PARTNERSHIP.&mdash;What
we have said applies to the ordinary partnership.
There are certain forms of partnership which
we can only mention. One of them is the limited
partnership. Limited partnerships are created under
the law of the State in which the business is to be
conducted and in a general way, these limited partnerships
are a combination of the principles underlying
ordinary partnerships and corporations. The
members may limit their liability to a certain amount,
and in that sense, the limited partnership is like a corporation.
On the other hand, the general principles
of partnership, as we shall discuss them, apply with
almost equal force to the acts of a limited partnership.
A person should not undertake to give an opinion as
to a legal problem relating to a limited partnership
until the law of the State in which the limited partnership
is organized has been consulted.</p>

<p>JOINT STOCK COMPANIES.&mdash;Occasionally
we meet with organizations&mdash;joint stock companies&mdash;which
occupy a sort of "No-man's land" between
partnerships and corporations. The joint stock company
issues shares of stock the same as a corporation.
These shares are listed on the stock exchange, as for
example, the Adams Express Company. The joint
stock company, however, carries with it the individual
liability of the shareholders for the debts of the company,
which is technically a partnership attribute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
The New York Court of Appeals in People ex rel.
Winchester v. Coleman, 133 N. Y. 279, has put it this
way: "More or less, they crowd upon and overlap
each other, but without losing their identity, and so,
while we cannot say that a joint stock company is a
corporation, we can say * * * that the joint stock
company is a partnership with some of the powers of
a corporation."</p>

<p>HOW TO DETERMINE WHETHER A
PARTNERSHIP EXISTS.&mdash;In a case, not tried in
court, the facts were: A Gloucester cod-fishing vessel
made an unsuccessful fishing voyage. The sailors
were to secure a certain portion of the profits of the
voyage as their wages. When the ship returned to
port, an attempt was made to collect bills incurred on
the trip and to hold the seamen liable along with the
owners of the vessel, as partners. It was contended
that sharing in the profits made them partners. While
this is true generally, this particular custom, whereby
a laborer receives a certain portion of the profits of
an undertaking as his wages, does not of itself constitute
him a partner with the person operating the
vessel. This point has been decided several times.
Such questions as these arise and cause great difficulty
in determining whether a partnership exists.
At times it is very important, as in the case of the
seamen, to know whether or not they can be made
to assume the obligations pertaining to the partnership
relations. While we cannot go into these relations
in detail, the framers of the Uniform Partnership
Act have laid down, with the utmost care, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
rules which are to be used in determining whether a
partnership exists or not. But, you say, why cannot
the parties avoid all this difficulty by making a
written agreement clearing up the entire matter?
They could. It is the simplest matter in the world.
But the trouble comes because a partnership arrangement
is so easy to enter into, and requires so little
formality, that it is taken for granted that it will come
out satisfactorily, and the precautions which should
be taken are sometimes forgotten. Hence, we have
to have rules of interpretation to help us when the
parties themselves have not taken the necessary precautions
to make matters clear. These rules of interpretation
are very clearly and very definitely laid
down in the Uniform Partnership Act, in the following
language:</p>

<p>(1) Except as provided by Section 16, persons
who are not partners as to each other are not partners
as to third persons.</p>

<p>(2) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy
by the entireties, joint property, common property,
or part ownership does not of itself establish a partnership,
whether such co-owners do or do not share
any profits made by the use of the property.</p>

<p>(3) The sharing of gross returns does not of
itself establish a partnership, whether or not the persons
sharing them have a joint or common right or
interest in any property from which the returns are
derived.</p>

<p>(4) The receipt by a person of a share of the
profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
is a partner in the business, but no such inference
shall be drawn if such profits were received in payment:</p>

<p>(a) As a debt by installments or otherwise,</p>

<p>(b) As wages of an employee or rent to a landlord,</p>

<p>(c) As an annuity to a widow or representative
of a deceased partner,</p>

<p>(d) As interest on a loan, though the amount of
payment vary with the profits of the business,</p>

<p>(e) As the consideration for the sale of the good-will
of a business or other property by installments
or otherwise.</p>

<p>Section 16.&mdash;(Partner by estoppel.)&mdash;(1) When
a person by words spoken or written or by conduct,
represents himself, or consents to another representing
him to any one, as a partner in an existing partnership
or with one or more persons not actual partners,
he is liable to any such person to whom such
representation has been made, who has, on the faith
of such representation, given credit to the actual or
apparent partnership, and if he has made such representation
or consented to its being made in a public
manner, he is liable to such person, whether the representation
has or has not been made or communicated
to such person * * *.</p>

<p>FOR WHAT PURPOSES MAY A PARTNERSHIP
BE CREATED.&mdash;A partnership may be
created to carry on any lawful business, and whatever
the individuals may do lawfully as such, two or more
may do together in a group as a partnership. Professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
occupations may be carried on in the partnership
form advantageously. This is one case where
a partnership has an advantage over a corporation.
A group of lawyers may form a partnership and do
business under a partnership name. But a group of
lawyers seldom or never form corporations to practice
law. The reason for this is that the corporation
is a separate entity, and the corporation as such cannot
pass a bar examination and be admitted to the
bar. In fact, in a few States, there are statutes prohibiting
a corporation from practicing law. There
is, therefore, very little advantage in creating a corporation
which cannot itself do the thing for which it
was created.</p>

<p>ILLEGAL OBJECT.&mdash;A partnership which is
formed to carry on any illegal purpose is, of course,
not recognized by law. Thus, if A, B, and C form a
partnership to engage in the gambling business and
they elect C as treasurer and have a successful business
so that they have a large amount of money on
hand, A and B may not be able to reap the profits of
the venture. C has the money. The agreement was
that all were to share equally, but C insists on keeping
it all. The law will allow him to do so, because
it is beneath the dignity of the court to order an
accounting in a transaction where all parties are
equally guilty. The maxim is "in pari delicto, condicio
defendentis potior est", that is, where the parties
are in equal fault, the position of the defendant is the
stronger. C, the guilty party, has the money; he is
the defendant, therefore, he keeps it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>WHO MAY BE PARTNERS.&mdash;At common
law, a married woman was incapable of becoming a
member of a partnership because of her general incapacity
to enter a contract. Statutes removing the
disability of married women have been passed in practically
all the States, and a married woman is generally
free to become a partner, except, and this is
true in many States still, husband and wife may not
become partners. An infant may be a member of a
firm on the same general principles as applied to ordinary
infant's contracts. His entering the partnership
agreement is not void, but voidable. When he
becomes of age, if he affirms the contract of partnership,
he will be liable the same as an adult. He has,
however, the right to disaffirm his partnership agreement
within a reasonable time after becoming of age,
and if he does so, he will be absolved from all personal
liability for the debts of the firm. It is very
generally held that a corporation may not enter into
a copartnership with another corporation or an individual.
The reason for this is a general rule of public
policy that in a partnership the corporation would be
bound by the acts of persons who are not its duly
appointed agents and officers. There may be any
number of members in a firm, such matters being left
to the choice and wisdom of those operating the business.</p>

<p>DELECTUS PERSONARUM.&mdash;While the
foregoing is true, one must not reach the conclusion
that an objectionable person may be forced into a
firm. I am a member of a firm of three persons. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
decide to withdraw, and tell my two fellow partners
that I have transferred all my interest in the firm to
John Jones. He will take my place. My two fellow
partners believe Jones to be a crook, and do not wish
to be in partnership with him. They would not be
obliged to accept him. In other words, the doctrine
of delectus personarum, or the choice of the person,
is strictly applied in partnership, because a partnership
relation is a very confidential relationship. Ordinarily
the business cannot be conducted satisfactorily
unless all of the partners have the confidence of each
other. It is for this reason, that we have the rule,
heretofore referred to, that the sale by a partner of
his interest in the business works a dissolution of the
partnership. John Jones, who purchased my rights
in the firm, could not compel the other members to
take him in, but the firm would have to be wound up
and he would simply be able to recover what my share
of the assets was. It is true that Section 27 of the
Act does read that a sale by a partner of his interest
does not of itself work a dissolution, but the doctrine
of delectus personarum is fully preserved. That section
reads: (1) A conveyance by a partner of his
interest in the partnership does not of itself dissolve
the partnership, nor, as against the other partners in
the absence of agreement, entitle the assignee, during
the continuance of the partnership, to interfere in the
management or administration of the partnership
business or affairs, or to require any information or
account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the
partnership books; but it merely entitles the assignee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to receive in accordance with his contract the profits
to which the assigning partner would otherwise be
entitled.</p>

<p>(2) In case of a dissolution of the partnership,
the assignee is entitled to receive his assignor's interest
and may require an account from the date only of
the last account agreed to by all the partners.</p>

<p>ARTICLES OF PARTNERSHIP.&mdash;We have
learned that parties need not expressly declare themselves
partners, or enter into an express contract, in
order to become partners. So the framing of written
partnership articles&mdash;a written contract of partnership&mdash;is
not essential, though it is the ordinary and
advisable course. We may note here a few rules governing
the use and construction of such articles where
they have been adopted. They should, of course, provide
for as many contingencies as can be foreseen,
such as the nature, name and place of business, when
the relation is to commence and when to terminate,
what capital shall be contributed by each, what the
share of each in the profits and losses shall be, what
the powers of the partners as between themselves
shall be, whether the business shall be continued after
the death of one or more of the partners and how it
shall be wound up. But the important thing to note
is, that if provision be not made, the general law, and
particularly that part governing the powers and
duties of partners to each other and to third persons,
applies. In other words, the partners may, by their
contract, determine what their rights as between
themselves shall be; but if they do not, the rules of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
law will determine them. Thus they may determine
that of two partners one shall have two-thirds and
the other one-third of the profits; in the absence of
such a clause the law determines the profits shall be
divided equally. When articles have been once
adopted they can be changed only by the consent of
all the partners; this consent need not be formally
expressed in words, but it may be implied from a long-continued
course of conduct. The law provides no
means to force a partner to live up to his contract
except in a very few cases; the most it gives is a right
of action for the breach caused by his failure to do as
agreed.</p>

<p>FIRM NAME.&mdash;The adoption of a firm name is
not an essential to a partnership, but is customary and
advisable. The names of the partners may be combined,
or a single name used, or a fictitious name, or
any name, so long as the rights of other persons are
not violated. In some States, notably New York, the
use of the name of a person not a partner is forbidden,
as is also the use of the expression "&amp; Co.," unless a
partner is represented by it. Ordinarily, contracts
may be made in the firm name and by one partner,
but contracts under seal should be made in the names
of the partners "doing business as," etc., and cannot
be made by one partner without authority from the
others. Conveyances of real property should be made
to or by the individual partners "doing business as,"
etc., for the law does not generally recognize the firm
as a separate person or entity sufficiently to enable it
as such to take or give a conveyance. If the deed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
ran to "John Doe &amp; Co.," the title would be in John
Doe only, though he would be said to hold it in trust
for the firm, for if the partnership name is given as
the grantee, the title goes only to those whose names
appear, and if the partnership were doing business
under a fictitious name, the deed would convey to no
one. Whether land, the title to which is in the name
of one partner, is held in trust by him as partnership
property, is a question of intention, and that question
is determined by asking with what money was the
land bought, what use has it been put to, has it been
carried on the books of the firm, with what money
have the taxes, insurance, and other charges been
paid, etc. If found to have been treated as partnership
property, the fact that the title is in one person
counts for little, as he will be said to hold it in trust
for the firm; but the careful business man will avoid
trouble by having the property conveyed to the firm
in the manner indicated, if it is actually partnership
property.</p>

<p>THE POWERS OF A PARTNER.&mdash;As a general
agent, a partner has almost unlimited authority
to bind the firm. Because of this, we have here one
reason for not recommending the partnership form of
doing business unless all the members of the firm
have the utmost confidence in each other. These
powers of the partners are so general that it is impossible
for us to go into them in any detail. They
are summarized in the most compact form in the
Uniform Partnership Act. Sections 9 to 17 of that
act are as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>9. (1) Every partner is an agent of the partnership
for the purpose of its business, and the act of
every partner, including the execution in the partnership
name of any instrument, for apparently carrying
on in the usual way the business of the partnership of
which he is a member, binds the partnership, unless
the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act
for the partnership in the particular matter, and the
person with whom he is dealing has knowledge of the
fact that he has no such authority.</p>

<p>(2) An act of a partner, which is not apparently
for the carrying on of the business of the partnership
in the usual way, does not bind the partnership unless
authorized by the other partners.</p>

<p>(3) Unless authorized by the other partners or
unless they have abandoned the business, one or
more but less than all the partners have no authority
to:</p>

<blockquote><p>(a) Assign the partnership property in trust
for creditors or on the assignee's promise to pay
the debts of the partnership,</p>

<p>(b) Dispose of the good-will of the business,</p>

<p>(c) Do any other act which would make it impossible
to carry on the ordinary business of the
partnership,</p>

<p>(d) Confess a judgment,</p>

<p>(e) Submit a partnership claim or liability to
arbitration or reference.</p></blockquote>

<p>(4) No act of a partner in contravention of a restriction
on his authority shall bind the partnership
to persons having knowledge of the restriction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>10. (1) Where title to real property is in the
partnership name, any partner may convey title to
such property by a conveyance executed in the partnership
name; but the partnership may recover such
property unless the partner's act binds the partnership
under the provisions of paragraph (1) of Section
9, or unless such property has been conveyed by
the grantee, or a person claiming through such
grantee to a holder for value without knowledge that
the partner, in making the conveyance, has exceeded
his authority.</p>

<p>(2) Where title to real property is in the name
of the partnership, a conveyance executed by a partner,
in his own name, passes the equitable interest of
the partnership, provided the act is one within the
authority of the partner under the provisions of paragraph
(1) of Section 9.</p>

<p>(3) Where title to real property is in the name of
one or more but not all the partners, and the record
does not disclose the right of the partnership, the
partners in whose name the title stands may convey
title to such property, but the partnership may recover
such property if the partners' act does not bind
the partnership under the provisions of paragraph (1)
of Section 9, unless the purchaser or his assignee, is
a holder for value, without knowledge.</p>

<p>(4) Where the title to real property is in the
name of one or more or all the partners, or in a third
person in trust for the partnership, a conveyance executed
by a partner in the partnership name, or in his
own name, passes the equitable interest of the partnership,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
provided the act is one within the authority
of the partner under the provisions of paragraph (1)
of Section 9.</p>

<p>(5) Where the title to real property is in the
names of all the partners, a conveyance executed by
all the partners passes all their rights in such
property.</p>

<p>11. An admission or representation made by any
partner concerning partnership affairs within the
scope of his authority as conferred by this act is evidence
against the partnership.</p>

<p>12. Notice to any partner of any matter relating
to partnership affairs, and the knowledge of the partner
acting in the particular matter, acquired while a
partner or then present to his mind, and the knowledge
of any other partner who reasonably could and
should have communicated it to the acting partner,
operate as notice to or knowledge of the partnership,
except in the case of a fraud on the partnership committed
by or with the consent of that partner.</p>

<p>13. Where, by any wrongful act or omission of
any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business
of the partnership, or with the authority of his
co-partners, loss or injury is caused to any person,
not being a partner in the partnership, or any penalty
is incurred, the partnership is liable therefor to the
same extent as the partner so acting or omitting to
act.</p>

<p>14. The partnership is bound to make good the
loss:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>(a) Where one partner acting within the
scope of his apparent authority receives money or
property of a third person and misapplies it; and</p>

<p>(b) Where the partnership in the course of its
business receives money or property of a third person
and the money or property so received is misapplied
by any partner while it is in the custody of
the partnership.</p></blockquote>

<p>15. All partners are liable</p>

<blockquote><p>(a) Jointly and severally for everything
chargeable to the partnership under Sections 13
and 14.</p>

<p>(b) Jointly for all other debts and obligations
of the partnership; but any partner may enter into
a separate obligation to perform a partnership contract.</p></blockquote>

<p>16. (1) When a person, by words spoken or
written or by conduct, represents himself, or consents
to another representing him to any one, as a
partner in an existing partnership or with one or
more persons not actual partners, he is liable to any
such person to whom such representation has been
made, who has, on the faith of such representation,
given credit to the actual or apparent partnership,
and if he has made such representation or consented
to its being made in a public manner, he is liable to
such person, whether the representation has or has
not been made or communicated to such person so
giving credit by or with the knowledge of the apparent
partner making the representation or consenting
to its being made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>(a) When a partnership liability results, he is
liable as though he were an actual member of the
partnership.</p>

<p>(b) When no partnership liability results, he
is liable jointly with the other persons, if any, so
consenting to the contract or representation as to
incur liability, otherwise separately.</p></blockquote>

<p>(2) When a person has been thus represented to
be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one
or more persons not actual partners, he is an agent
of the persons consenting to such representation to
bind them to the same extent and in the same manner
as though he were a partner in fact, with respect to
persons who rely upon the representation. Where
all the members of the existing partnership consent
to the representation, a partnership act or obligation
results; but in all other cases it is the joint act or
obligation of the person acting and the person consenting
to the representation.</p>

<p>17. A person admitted as a partner into an existing
partnership is liable for all the obligations of the
partnership arising before his admission as though he
had been a partner when such obligations were incurred,
except that this liability shall be satisfied only
out of partnership property.</p>

<p>POWERS OF A MAJORITY OF PARTNERS.&mdash;If
partners disagree, then a majority of them have
power to decide what shall be done; but there are
limits even to the power of a majority. They can
only carry on the business of the firm, and any vote
of the majority, or action of the majority, to change
the character of the business for which the firm was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
organized, or to make any fundamental change in
the original articles of the partnership, would be
invalid.</p>

<p>RELATION OF PARTNERS TO ONE ANOTHER.&mdash;The
rules determining the rights and
duties of partners in relation to the partnership are
concisely but fully set forth in the Act as follows:</p>

<p>18. The rights and duties of the partners in relation
to the partnership shall be determined, subject to
any agreement between them, by the following rules:</p>

<p>(a) Each partner shall be repaid his contributions,
whether by way of capital or advances to the
partnership property and share equally in the profits
and surplus remaining after all liabilities, including
those to partners, are satisfied; and must contribute
towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise,
sustained by the partnership according to his share
in the profits.</p>

<p>(b) The partnership must indemnify every partner
in respect of payment made and personal liabilities
reasonably incurred by him in the ordinary and
proper conduct of its business, or for the preservation
of its business or property.</p>

<p>(c) A partner who, in aid of the partnership,
makes any payment or advance beyond the amount
of capital which he agreed to contribute, shall be paid
interest from the date of the payment or advance.</p>

<p>(d) A partner shall receive interest on the capital
contributed by him only from the date when repayment
should be made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>(e) All partners have equal rights in the management
and conduct of the partnership business.</p>

<p>(f) No partner is entitled to remuneration for
acting in the partnership business, except that a surviving
partner is entitled to reasonable compensation
for his services in winding up the partnership
affairs.</p>

<p>(g) No person can become a member of a partnership
without the consent of all the partners.</p>

<p>(h) Any difference arising as to ordinary matters
connected with the partnership business may be
decided by a majority of the partners; but no act in
contravention of any agreement between the partners
may be done rightly without the consent of all
the partners.</p>

<p>19. The partnership books shall be kept, subject
to any agreement between the partners, at the principal
place of business of the partnership, and every
partner shall at all times have access to and may inspect
and copy any of them.</p>

<p>20. Partners shall render on demand true and
full information of all things affecting the partnership
to any partner or the legal representative of any
deceased partner or partner under legal disability.</p>

<p>21. (1) Every partner must account to the partnership
for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any
profits derived by him without the consent of the
other partners from any transaction connected with
the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the partnership
or from any use by him of its property.</p>

<p>(2) This section applies also to the representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of a deceased partner engaged in the liquidation
of the affairs of the partnership as the personal representatives
of the last surviving partner.</p>

<p>22. Any partner shall have the right to a formal
account as to partnership affairs:</p>

<p>(a) If he is wrongfully excluded from the partnership
business or possession of its property by his
co-partners.</p>

<p>(b) If the right exists under the terms of any
agreement.</p>

<p>(c) As provided by Section 21.</p>

<p>(d) Whenever other circumstances renders it
just and reasonable.</p>

<p>TERMINATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP.&mdash;A
partnership is terminated either by act of the
partners, or by law. Under the first heading, we may
mention such things as the partnership being terminated
by the accomplishment of the object for
which the same was formed, or by the termination
of the time during which the partnership was to exist,
or by mutual consent of all parties concerned. Under
the head of termination by operation of law, we have
such topics as the death of a partner, the insanity of
a partner, or the bankruptcy of a partner, and a dissolution
by a court, as for example, where it is absolutely
certain, in the opinion of the court, that the
business cannot be successfully continued longer. In
such a case, although some of the partners may not
wish to wind up the affairs of the business, the court
may order it done in the interest of all parties concerned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>OWNERSHIP OF FIRM PROPERTY AND
CREDITORS' RIGHTS.&mdash;The firm property is
owned by all the partners jointly, but the interest of
each individual partner is not an interest in each piece
of firm property, but a right to have an accounting
and to receive on the accounting such share of the
assets as belong to him when all debts due from him
to the firm and all liabilities to the outside world are
settled. Consequently, a creditor of an individual
partner cannot seize or attach or levy on firm property,
because that firm property does not belong, nor
does any part of it belong, to his debtor. The creditor
must file a bill in equity asking that the partner's
share be determined, and that on an accounting so
much as is found due to the debtor partner be applied
to discharge that partner's indebtedness.</p>

<p>THE DIVISION OF ASSETS.&mdash;Upon final
dissolution, the question of division of assets comes
up, and the Uniform Partnership Act gives us the
general rule as to how the firm's assets are divided.
Section 40 of the Act reads:</p>

<p>In settling accounts between the parties after
dissolution, the following rules shall be observed, subject
to any agreement to the contrary:</p>

<blockquote><p>(a) The assets of the partnership are:</p>

<p>I. The partnership property,</p>

<p>II. The contributions of the partners necessary
for the payment of all the liabilities specified
in clause (b) of this paragraph.</p>

<p>(b) The liabilities of the partnership shall rank
in order of payment, as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>I. Those owing to creditors other than partners,</p>

<p>II. Those owing to partners other than for
capital and profits,</p>

<p>III. Those owing to partners in respect of
capital,</p>

<p>IV. Those owing to partners in respect of
profits.</p>

<p>(c) The assets shall be applied in the order of
their declaration in clause (a) of this paragraph to
the satisfaction of the liabilities.</p>

<p>(d) The partners shall contribute, as provided
by Section 18 (a) the amount necessary to satisfy the
liabilities; but if any, but not all, of the partners are
insolvent, or, not being subject to process, refuse to
contribute, the other partners shall contribute their
share of the liabilities, and, in the relative proportions
in which they share the profits, the additional amount
necessary to pay the liabilities.</p>

<p>(e) An assignee for the benefit of creditors or
any person appointed by the court shall have the right
to enforce the contributions specified in clause (d) of
this paragraph.</p>

<p>(f) Any partner or his legal representative shall
have the right to enforce the contributions specified
in clause (d) of this paragraph, to the extent of the
amount which he has paid in excess of his share of
the liability.</p>

<p>(g) The individual property of a deceased partner
shall be liable for the contributions specified in
clause (d) of this paragraph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>(h) When partnership property and the individual
properties of the partners are in the possession
of a court for distribution, partnership creditors shall
have priority on partnership property, and separate
creditors on individual property, saving the rights of
lien or secured creditors as heretofore.</p>

<p>(i) Where a partner has become bankrupt or his
estate is insolvent, the claims against his separate
property shall rank in the following order:</p>

<p>I. Those owing to separate creditors,</p>

<p>II. Those owing to partnership creditors,</p>

<p>III. Those owing to partners by way of contribution.</p></blockquote>

<p>LIQUIDATION OF PARTNERSHIP.&mdash;When
a partnership is dissolved, it is common for the business
to require liquidation, and frequently one or
more of the partners are what are called liquidating
partners. If a partnership is dissolved by death, for
instance, the surviving partners have a right to be
liquidating partners and liquidate the business. That
means they may carry on existing contracts; they
may dispose of the stock on hand to the best advantage.
If this requires incidental purchases of new
goods, they may be made, but in general, new business
cannot be undertaken. The function of a liquidating
partner is to satisfy existing contracts, reduce
the property of the firm to cash, and then distribute
it to those who are entitled to receive it.</p>

<p>LIMITED PARTNERSHIP.&mdash;Statutes, as we
have learned, in many States permit the formation
of limited partnerships, the object of which is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
enable one or more partners to avoid unlimited liability
for debts. Partners in a general partnership
are each liable, individually, for the full amount of
the firm's indebtedness. If one partner is thus compelled
to pay more than his share, he may seek redress
by demanding contribution from his fellow partners,
and if they are not solvent, he will not be able to
secure reimbursement. If there is one solvent partner,
for instance, and two other partners, both of
whom become insolvent, the result will be that the
first partner will have to pay the debts of the firm
and will have no redress except such as he may be
able to get from the insolvent estates of his two partners.
Now, in a limited partnership a limited partner
does not stand to lose any more than the amount of
money he actually puts in the firm. In order to create
a limited partnership it is necessary to sign a certificate
prepared for the purpose and stating the facts,
file it in the office of the Secretary of State or other
official, and also publish it so that the public may be
informed of the circumstances and credit may not
be given by the world at large to the firm on the
assumption that the limited partner is a general partner.
He puts a specified amount of money in the firm
and that money may be reached by creditors of the
firm, but they cannot hold him further liable. A good
definition of a limited partnership follows: A limited
partnership is one which consists of one or more persons
called general partners and also one or more
persons called special partners. Every general partner
is an agent for the partnership in the transaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of its business and has authority to do whatever is
necessary to carry on such business in the ordinary
manner. Every general partner is liable to third persons,
jointly and severally, with his general co-partners
for all of the obligations of the partnership. A
special partner may only advise as to the management
of the partnership and he is liable for the obligations
of the partnership only to the amount of
capital invested by him therein.</p>

<p>SILENT PARTNERS.&mdash;A silent partner must
not be confused with a member of a limited partnership.
A silent partner is a general partner who takes
no part in the active management of the business and
frequently is a secret partner. A member of a limited
partnership can never be a secret partner, since the
terms of a limited partnership must be published. A
member of a limited partnership should take no part
in the management of the business, or he may render
himself liable as a general partner. The limited partnership
law requires, moreover, that he must have
exactly complied with the law by making out, filing
and publishing a certificate. The statutes of the
State should be consulted on this point and closely
adhered to.</p>

<p>LIMITED.&mdash;We often see also in print, so and
so "Ltd." This does not mean a limited partnership.
The word "limited" is used in the name of an English
or Canadian company organized under the English
or Canadian statutes, but such companies are rather
analogous to corporations than to limited partnerships.
The liability in such companies is limited altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
to the assets in the company's hands. There
are no general partners. The liability of all stockholders
is limited. The English and Canadian law
requires that the word Limited be added to the name,
so that the public may not be deceived into believing
that the company is a partnership.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
Corporations</h2>


<p>THE NATURE OF A CORPORATION.&mdash;The
nature of a corporation is perhaps best understood
by an illustration. In the case of People's
Pleasure Park Co. v. Rohleder, 109 Va. 439, the
facts were as follows: There was a large tract of land
divided up into a number of lots, and in each deed,
when a lot was sold, there was a covenant providing
that title to the real property should never vest in a
person of African descent, or in a colored person.
Later, after the lots had been sold, several of them
were conveyed to a corporation composed exclusively
of negroes. The corporation knew, when it purchased
the tract of land, of this restriction in the deed,
and the land was bought by it for the purpose of
establishing an amusement park for colored people.
Suit was brought in a court of equity to compel the
cancellation of the deed to the corporation. Stated
boldly, the decision of the Virginia court amounts to
an assertion that a corporation has no color. In other
words, the corporation is an entity separate and distinct
from its members, and so, although all the stockholders
in this corporation were colored, that did not
make the corporation a colored person. Thus, if A,
B, and C, as incorporators, organize the X Corporation,
although they are the sole stockholders,
there are four persons, A, B, C, and the X Corporation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>THE ENTITY THEORY.&mdash;It may be doubted
if any court would carry the entity theory to the extent
that it would allow an individual who was the
owner of a piece of real estate, which he was not permitted
by the deed to sell to negroes, to deliberately
go to a prospective negro purchaser and say: "I cannot
sell my property to you because of a restriction
in the deed, but I will pay the necessary expenses, if
you, with two of your friends, will form a corporation
to take title to this property, in which corporation
each of your friends will own one share and you
the balance, thus retaining control yourself. I will
then deed the property to the corporation and will
thereby get around the covenant in my deed preventing
a transfer to negroes." We must not allow the
entity theory to work a manifest injustice, as was
said in Erickson v. Revere Elevator Co., 110 Minn.
443: "Where the corporate form is used by individuals
for the purpose of evading the law, or for the perpetration
of fraud, the courts will not permit the legal
entity to be interposed so as to defeat justice."</p>

<p>RESULTS OF THE ENTITY THEORY.&mdash;Flowing
from the entity theory is the result that the
property of a corporation is owned by the corporation
and not by the individual members. Therefore, all
conveyances of such property, whether it is real property
or personal property, must be made by the corporation,
and cannot be made by the members or
shareholders as individuals. It also follows that all
suits against or by the corporation must be brought
against the corporation or by the corporation as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
entity and not against the individual members. Again,
a corporation may take property from one of its individual
members, and it may make a contract with
one of them, and it may sue them and be sued by
them.</p>

<p>KINDS OF CORPORATIONS.&mdash;Corporations
are divided into public, quasi-public, and private corporations.
The private corporation is such as is created
for private enterprises, such as manufacturing,
banking, and trading corporations. Religious and
eleemosynary corporations are also included in this
classification. The public corporation is such as is
created for the purposes of government, such as cities,
towns, villages, and institutions founded by the State,
and managed by it for governmental purposes. Quasi-public
corporations are such as are engaged in a private
business which is affected with a public interest,
such as railroads, both steam and electric, gas companies,
water companies, lighting companies, and the
like. The public, and generally the quasi-public, corporations
possess the right of eminent domain, that
is, the right to take private property for public purposes
upon payment of just compensation to the
owner. It is the private corporation with which we
are usually concerned in commercial law, and this
chapter will be devoted largely to a discussion of that
class.</p>

<p>THE CREATION OF A CORPORATION.&mdash;A
corporation must be created by legislative authority.
Formerly, a corporation was created by special act of
the legislature, but in recent years the growth in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
number of corporations, and also the political wire-pulling
necessary to get an incorporation bill through
a legislature, have resulted in the almost universal
practice of having the legislature pass a general corporation
act, and then without further reference to
the legislature, any group of persons, of the requisite
number, may become incorporated by complying with
the provisions of such an act. The formation of corporations
under the laws of most States is a simple
process, requiring in general the preparation of an
official document sometimes termed the "certificate
of incorporation" or the "charter," which paper sets
forth the facts which are required under the laws of
the State wherein the corporation is to be formed.
These laws, while not uniform, generally require a
statement as to the name to be used by the corporation,
the names of the proposed directors and incorporators,
a statement of the general purposes or objects
of the corporation, the location of its principal
office and place of business, how long it is to last, the
amount of its authorized capital, the par value of its
stock, as well as a statement in regard to any preferred
stock which may be contemplated. Other details
are sometimes required under the various State
laws. This official document must generally be signed
or executed by those persons who are the incorporators
of the corporation. As a rule, three or more
incorporators are required, although in some States
five is the minimum. This official document, after it
has been duly executed, is usually to be filed in the
office of the Secretary of State, and usually also in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of the county clerk of the county wherein its principal
office is to be. This procedure, however, is subject to
some variations and the statutes of the State involved
must always be closely followed. As soon as the official
document has been properly filed and the other
necessary steps taken the incorporators hold the first
meeting and effect an organization, after which time
the corporation is generally in a position to transact
business, although in some States it is provided in
effect that corporations should not commence business
until a certain share of the capital has been paid
into the corporation in cash.</p>

<p>CITIZENSHIP OF A CORPORATION.&mdash;Although
a corporation is a separate entity, entirely distinct
and apart from its members, such separate entity
is not a citizen in the sense in which we use the
term ordinarily. At a general election a corporation
has no right to vote. Again, Article 4 Section 2, of
the United States Constitution, provides that "citizens
of each State shall be entitled to all of the privileges
and immunities of citizens in the several States." A
corporation is not a citizen in this sense. Hence a
State may keep all insurance companies, incorporated
outside of its area, from doing business in that State
by discriminating legislation against foreign insurance
corporations. Insurance is not looked upon as
interstate commerce, about which the individual
States may not legislate, and as a corporation is not a
citizen within the meaning of Article 4, Section 2,
such insurance companies have no redress. In one
sense, however, a corporation is looked upon as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
citizen. Where a suit is between citizens of different
States, and the amount involved is over the prescribed
sum, either party may bring the action in the Federal
courts, if he so desires, instead of in the State courts.
In this sense, a corporation is to be regarded as if it
were a citizen of the State in which it is created.
If I live in New York and the American Tobacco Co.
is incorporated in New Jersey, suit between us may
be brought in the Federal courts on the ground of diversity
of citizenship on the part of plaintiff and defendant.</p>

<p>POWERS OF CORPORATIONS.&mdash;A corporation
is unable to do anything beyond such powers as
are granted it by law. As to the extent of the powers
possessed by a corporation, we may conveniently divide
corporate powers into those which are express
and those which are implied. Express powers may be
considered as including those which are mentioned in
the official documents used or granted upon the beginning
of the existence of the corporation. These
official documents are spoken of as "charters" or "certificates
of incorporation." Whatever term may be
applied to them there is generally in such documents
a statement of the general purposes or objects for
which the corporation is formed; in other words, of the
general business in which it is to engage. There is
also a statement of the general powers of the corporation
which is to engage in the business mentioned.
The powers so mentioned in such official documents
may be termed, as we have stated, express powers
of the corporation. Needless to say, however, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
not usual or possible to attempt to indicate in any
such official documents all the details of the operations
of business. Therefore, it is necessary to imply
that in addition to such express powers the corporation
has power to do such acts as may be reasonably
necessary or incidental to the carrying on of the business
mentioned. Powers so implied, without words,
are termed "implied powers." Therefore, the total
powers of a corporation consist of the express powers,
namely, such as are named in the official documents
containing a statement of its purposes and the business
in which it is to engage, and the powers which
would be reasonably implied under the rule just mentioned,
as necessary and incidental to the carrying
out of the express powers. Such implied powers do
not give the corporation any power to do acts which
are not reasonably necessary and incidental in its regular
business. To allow validity to acts not so reasonably
necessary and incidental would be in reality
allowing the corporation to engage in outside business,
which, under its charter, it has no power to engage
in. As an illustration of this let us assume
that the X company was incorporated to build, run
and operate a railroad between two towns named A
and B. The official charter of the corporation may
state further details of the corporation's powers or it
may not. But, if such details are not stated, the corporation
would, obviously, have as express powers,
the power to build the road and to operate it between
the towns mentioned. It would also have as implied
powers the power to do any act reasonably necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
or incidental to the operation of a railroad, such for
example as the purchase of rails, ties or other railroad
supplies, the hiring of employees, erection of stations
and the power also to give negotiable paper in payment
for such supplies or the raising of money by
mortgaging its property or otherwise where necessary
to carry on its business. In other words, the corporation
may be said to have as implied powers all the
powers which an individual would reasonably and
usually exercise if he were operating the railroad.
However, the corporation would have no power, express
or implied, to do any act not reasonably necessary
to the railroad business, such, for example, as
the purchase of a stock farm or the operation of a
steamer line or a grocery store, or the leasing of its
line. If the corporation, then, should make any contract
with relation to engaging in these outside matters&mdash;the
corporation having no power to engage in
them&mdash;a valid contract could not arise and therefore
the corporation could not be held liable thereon.</p>

<p>ULTRA VIRES ACTS.&mdash;Where a corporation
attempts to do an act which is clearly beyond its express
or implied powers, such act is generally termed
an "ultra vires" act, and it may frequently consist in
an attempted contract by a corporation. Hence we
must consider with some care contracts of corporations
which may be termed ultra vires. As the corporation
lacks power it is generally said that the contract
does not arise and hence neither the corporation
nor the person with whom it attempted to contract
would theoretically be bound thereon. Yet, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
many States, a special rule has been adopted whereby
a corporation may be held upon such contract in certain
cases even though it had no power to make it.
This may be termed the "doctrine of estoppel," and
generally includes cases where the corporation has
assumed to make a contract which was ultra vires or
beyond its powers but which would appear to an outsider
as incidental to the corporate business and therefore
as within its corporate powers. In such circumstances,
if the outsider with whom the corporation
assumed to make the contract does in fact rely reasonably
upon the corporate power to make it, having
been deceived by appearances and having no warning
that the corporation actually lacked power, and having
paid over money or delivered goods or performed
services or parted with other value under the contract,
he may generally enforce the contract against the
corporation. In other words, under such circumstances,
the corporation is estopped or forbidden to
evade its obligation by asserting the point that it had
no power to make such contract. However, this is
strictly limited to cases where the corporation appeared
to have the power to make the contract and
where the person dealing with it had no reason to
suspect or doubt its power in that regard, and where
the person dealing with the corporation had parted
with some value of the kind mentioned, in his reliance
that the contract was within the corporate powers
of and therefore binding upon the corporation.
Thus, where such person has done nothing toward
carrying out his duty under the contract he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
have no claim or right to enforce the same as a binding
obligation of the corporation. Many courts also
treat him somewhat differently and take the attitude
that an outsider who has dealt with the corporation
is entitled not to enforce the attempted contract, but
is entitled only to recover from the corporation the
reasonable value of such goods or service as it has
voluntarily accepted from him.</p>

<p>DE FACTO AND DE JURE CORPORATIONS.&mdash;It
sometimes happens that a group of persons
may attempt to organize a corporation and fail
to comply with all the provisions of the law in the
State in which they attempt to organize. The question
arises then: What have we? Of course, we do
not have a full completed organization, which we
would call a corporation de jure (by right of law).
We may have what is called a corporation de facto (in
fact). In order to constitute a corporation de facto, it
is generally held that the following requisites must exist:
There must be a valid law which authorizes the
formation of such a corporation; a colorable attempt to
organize under the provision of such law; and an assumption
of corporate power, or, as is sometimes
called, a user. If these facts exist, we then have a corporation
de facto, and persons dealing with such a
corporation are usually held to the same responsibilities
as though it was an actual de jure corporation.
The State, ordinarily, is the only person which can
question the existence of such a body, and this is usually
done in a suit by the attorney-general. If the
parties have not even complied with the requisites of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
a de facto corporation, the authorities are divided as
to what kind of an organization it is, although, perhaps,
the best decisions would hold the parties liable
as partners. They must have contemplated some
kind of liability and failing to create even a corporation
de facto, a partnership liability is all that is left,
except individual liability, and that is apparently just
what they did not intend.</p>

<p>PROMOTERS.&mdash;A promoter is a very common
person in the modern industrial world. He is a person
who brings about the organization of corporations,
gets the people together who are interested in the enterprise,
aids in procuring subscriptions, and takes
general charge of all the matters incident to the formation
of the corporation. In other ways, he is governed
by the rules of agency and his position is that
of a fiduciary. The majority of the courts hold that
there is no liability on the part of the corporation to
pay for his expenses and his services, in promoting
the organization, unless the corporation as an organization
expressly promises to pay or otherwise clearly
recognizes the obligation. Because of the fiduciary relationship,
which a promoter occupies, he is not permitted
to make any secret profits at the expense of the
corporation. If he secures property for $1,000,000, he
may not turn it over to the corporation for $1,500,000
and pocket the profit himself. A corporation cannot
be liable for the acts of a promoter before the corporation
came into existence. It may, however, after coming
into existence adopt the acts of the promoter and
thereby render itself liable. If, knowing the terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
an agreement made by a promoter, the corporation
takes advantage of the agreement or recognizes it,
it thereby in effect itself becomes a party to the agreement.
Unless the terms of a promoter's agreement
expressly state the contrary, the promoter is personally
liable upon it as a contractor.</p>

<p>POWER OF THE STATE OVER A CORPORATION.&mdash;It
must follow, that if a State creates a
corporation, then it should have certain control over
it. The United States Supreme Court has recognized
the right of visitation as residing in the State. Visitation
is, in law, the act of a superior or superintendent
officer who visits a corporation to examine into its
manner of conducting business and its observance of
the laws. The visitation of National banks by the
Comptroller of the Currency is a common example of
the exercise of this authority. One of the most famous
cases in the United States Supreme Court is the
Dartmouth College case. In 1769, the King of England
granted a charter to twelve people under the
name of "The Trustees of Dartmouth College." They
were authorized to conduct a college and they founded
Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. In
1816, the legislature in the State of New Hampshire
undertook to amend the charter in many ways, among
other things, increasing the number of trustees to
twenty-one. A furious conflict ensued between the
State and the trustees. The State finally brought suit
to recover the corporate seal and records which were
held by a Mr. Woodward, who held them under the
amendatory act to which we have referred. The case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
is known as Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4
Wheaton 518. The Dartmouth College trustees were
represented by Daniel Webster, and this is one of his
famous cases before the Supreme Court. He took the
position that the charter granted by the King of England
and afterwards recognized by the State of New
Hampshire, was a contract between the State and the
trustees. This being so, it was protected by the provision
in the United States Constitution which provides
that no State shall pass any law impairing the
obligation of contracts. The United States Supreme
Court upheld this position. The act of the legislature
of New Hampshire was held invalid. We then found
ourselves in the position of having States creating
corporations and then not being able to control them.
Whatever may be said in regard to the law as laid
down by the United States Supreme Court, this situation
was unfortunate. Shortly thereafter in the various
State legislatures, a method to meet the situation
was devised, and this is what was done: When a
general corporation law is passed, the State inserts
in it a clause to this effect: "The State hereby reserves
the right to alter, amend, or repeal the charter
of any corporation organized under this act." This,
then, makes this clause a part of the contract when a
new corporation is organized. It knows that it is
subject to having its charter amended or repealed
without its consent. The effects, therefore, of the
Dartmouth College decision have been practically
nullified by such clauses inserted in the various incorporation
laws. Such incorporation acts do not relate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
to corporations organized before such act was passed.
Under this method of procedure, the legislature today
surely has an efficacious method of controlling the
corporations which it creates.</p>

<p>LIABILITY FOR TORTS AND CRIMES.&mdash;A
corporation is ordinarily liable, the same as an individual,
for all torts committed by its agents in the
scope of their authority. A corporation may even be
liable for acts which are beyond its authority. For example,
in the case of Hannon v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 167
N. Y. 244, it was held that the department store of the
Siegel-Cooper Company, a corporation, was liable for
mal-practice in dentistry. The charter of the company
did not give the company the right to practice dentistry,
but space in the store was rented to a dentist
who conducted a dental parlor. Because of his negligent
treatment of a patient, the court held that the
corporation was liable for the negligent acts of its
agent. Corporations may also be held liable for such
torts as involve a mental element, like fraud and libel.
A corporation may be criminally responsible for failure
to perform a duty imposed upon it by law, and in
many States there are statutes which make it a criminal
offense for a corporation to do or fail to do certain
acts. It is generally held, however, that a corporation
cannot commit a crime which involves a mental operation,
as for example, murder. Murder involves a
mental operation; it is "killing with malice aforethought."
Then again, it would be difficult to punish
a corporation for the crime of murder, because under
our State constitutions, the punishment for murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
is either death or life imprisonment. Although a corporation
is a separate person, there is no way to kill
it or imprison it for life. You surely would not do so
by inflicting this penalty on all the stockholders. It is
generally provided, then, by statute that such crimes
that a corporation can commit are to be punished
either by a fine or by imprisonment of the directors.</p>

<p>SHERMAN ANTI-TRUST ACT.&mdash;On July 2,
1890, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was passed by Congress.
The first section of this act reads: "Every contract,
combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among
the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby
declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make
any such contract, or engage in any such combination
or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished
by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments,
in the discretion of the court." The second section of
this act reads: "Every person who shall monopolize,
or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with
any other person or persons to monopolize any part
of the trade or commerce among the several states,
or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished
by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or by imprisonment
not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments,
in the discretion of the court."</p>

<p>It would be impossible, in a small amount of
space, to call attention, except in a general way, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the importance of this act and the difficulty of understanding
it, without carefully reading the various conflicting
decisions of the United States Supreme Court
handed down since the passage of the act. The act,
being a Federal act, relates only to interstate commerce.
That kind of business, conducted by corporations,
which is intrastate, if controlled at all by similar
legislation, would be by virtue of a State act. Perhaps
the most famous of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act
cases decided by the United States Supreme Court is
that of the United States v. Standard Oil Co., 221 U.
S. 1, where the majority opinion was written by the
late Chief Justice White, and in which he enunciated
the so-called "rule of reason" which brings the interpretation
of that act very much in harmony with the
rules of the common law in regard to illegal contracts
and monopolies.</p>

<p>BY-LAWS.&mdash;A by-law is a permanent rule for
the government of a corporation and its officers. The
purpose of a by-law is to regulate and define the duties
of the members of the corporation toward the corporation
and between themselves. The power to
make the by-laws is vested in the stockholders. There
are certain qualifications which all by-laws must possess.
They must be reasonable and not inconsistent
with law or any rule of public policy. It would not
be possible for a majority of the stockholders at a
regular stockholders' meeting to pass by-laws which
would deliberately deprive the minority stockholders
of rights which belong to them. The by-laws are, of
course, always subject to the provisions of the charter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of the corporation, and if a corporation is authorized
to operate a railroad, it could not, by passing a by-law,
to the effect that it was deemed wise to enter into the
steel manufacturing business, change the nature of
the corporation in that manner.</p>

<p>STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.&mdash;In order that
the acts of the majority of stockholders shall be valid,
they must be authorized at a regular stockholders'
meeting. This must be held in the principal office of
the company, and the notice required by the by-laws
must be given to all of the stockholders. After this
is done, the majority of the stockholders may transact
business and bind the corporation. Of course, in
a large corporation with a hundred thousand shareholders,
as is the case with some of our bigger corporations
like the United States Steel Corporation and
the Pennsylvania Railroad, very few of the stockholders
actually attend the meetings. The directors usually
send out with the notice of the meeting, a proxy, and
the stockholders who are not able to be present send
in their proxy authorizing certain persons to vote for
them. In this way, a majority of the stockholders are
present at the meeting, either in person or by proxy.
In certain cases stockholders may interfere with the
action of directors in connection with the general management
of a corporation, or may even oust the directors
from their positions. These cases are extremely
rare, since the power of directors is supreme
as to all corporate matters as to which the statutes or
by-laws do not provide for concurrence or other action
by the stockholders. Where proof is offered, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
of fraud, violation of law or gross negligence
of the directors whereby loss has been caused or is
threatened, stockholders may in some cases obtain the
ousting of directors. This sometimes results in placing
a receiver in temporary charge of the corporation
or in the holding of a special election of new directors.
No complaint, however, will generally be entertained
against directors merely because their judgment does
not agree with that of the stockholders even if some
action of the directors may not have resulted favorably
to the corporation, provided such action was
taken honestly and with all due care and regard to
law. As an illustration, the directors of the X Company
made a certain contract on behalf of the corporation
whereby it was agreed with Y that property
of the corporation should be transferred to the latter
for much less than its evident actual value. This
operation would usually indicate fraud on the part of
the directors, or at least such gross negligence as
would in many cases justify stockholders in asking a
legal inquiry into the action of the directors, which
would result, if sufficient facts were proved, in their
removal and an injunction against the performance
of the contract. However, if the value of the property
were doubtful and the directors had used all due
care and effort to ascertain its true value and to obtain
the best available price, no complaint could usually
be made although it should later develop that a better
price might have been obtained.</p>

<p>FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.&mdash;A foreign corporation
is one which is organized under the laws of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
some foreign country or some other State. Foreign
corporations are not necessarily confined to doing
business in their own State; they may enter other
States. As for example, a company organized in New
Jersey may enter the State of New York and do business.
If, however, the New Jersey corporation comes
to New York and makes a regular practice of doing
business, it must comply with the provisions of the
corporation law of New York, and secure a license to
do business in New York. It is not uncommon to enforce
this provision in an indirect method by providing
that if a foreign corporation does not take out
this license, it shall not be allowed to sue in the courts
of the State where it is doing business.</p>

<p>MANAGEMENT OF CORPORATIONS.&mdash;The
management of any corporation rests directly
with the board of directors and they may be considered
as the agents of the corporation to direct its business
affairs. The directors, however, are subject in
their action to any limitation upon their power which
may have been included in the charter or certificate
of incorporation or which may have been adopted in
the by-laws. The directors are also subject to any
provisions in the statutes of the State, which frequently
provide that they shall not take certain important
actions, such as the mortgaging of corporate
property, etc., without special procedure involving a
meeting and vote of the stockholders. Where, however,
the directors' authority is not limited by the
statutes or the charter or by-laws, they may be considered
as having full power to manage the affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of the corporation. In connection with that power
they may elect a president and other corporate officers
and may appoint any other agents or employees at
their discretion. They may also define the powers to
be exercised by the president and the other officers
and employees. This would give them power to limit
the authority of the president or any other officer.
However, where a person deals with the president or
any other officer of a corporation in behalf of the corporation,
he may usually rely reasonably upon the
president or other officer having similar power to that
generally possessed by such an officer, and in many
cases the corporation would be held bound by the acts
of such officer even though he actually violated some
limits placed upon him by the directors. This may
be illustrated by assuming that the X Company was
in the business of manufacturing furniture, and A,
the president thereof, had made a contract with B,
an outsider, for the purchase from the latter of certain
wood to be used in the corporate business. As a
matter of fact, however, A, the president, had no
power to make such contract, since the directors had
passed a resolution forbidding him to purchase any
raw materials without first having the proposed purchase
approved by the board of directors. Therefore,
A, as a matter of fact, would have no power to make
the contract with B, on behalf of the corporation. Yet,
B had not in any way been warned of this limitation
upon A's power, and as the purchase of materials
would be a usual one for the president or executive
head of such a corporation to make, B might reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
assume that A had power to make the contract.
Therefore, B would be able to hold the corporation
to the contract under the principle of apparent authority,
considered in connection with the law of
agency. Naturally, in turn, the directors would have
a claim against the president for any loss sustained,
as he had not only violated his duty but had also disobeyed
and disregarded explicit instructions. The
by-laws of a corporation are generally adopted by the
stockholders and provide for all matters relating to
the corporate management which are not provided
for in the charter or certificate of incorporation. Such
by-laws are binding upon all persons who know of
them, or reasonably should know of them, provided
they are not in violation of law and are reasonable.
It is the general rule that meetings called to adopt
new by-laws or to alter previous by-laws should be
announced in some special way so that all interested
parties may receive due notice and thus have an opportunity
to arrange to be present and vote on the
matters to be taken up at such meeting.</p>

<p>ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.&mdash;The directors
of a corporation are elected by the stockholders and
the election generally takes place at the regular annual
meeting of stockholders of the corporation.
Either the entire board of directors is elected at that
time for the ensuing year, or a portion of them. In
this connection it is provided by the statutes of many
States that at least a certain proportion of the total
number of directors shall be elected annually. The
method of electing such directors at the annual meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
is usually provided for by the statutes of the various
States, but it is commonly the rule that each stockholder
shall have one vote for each share of stock
owned by him, although in some States they also allow
what is termed "cumulative voting." This
method of voting generally allows each stockholder to
have as many votes as he owns shares of stock multiplied
by the number of directors to be elected at the
meeting and he may cast all of his votes for one or
more of the candidates. In other words if five directors
are to be elected he may concentrate all his
votes upon one or more of the candidates and is not
compelled to vote for each one. This cumulative voting
is authorized for the purpose of allowing the
minority stockholders to concentrate their votes upon
one or two of the candidates and thus have some representation
upon the board of directors. As an illustration
of this, let us assume that the X Company
had an authorized capital stock of $100,000, composed
of 1,000 shares at the par value of $100 per share, and
that all these 1,000 shares are issued and fully paid
up. Let us further assume that six individuals each
own 100 shares of stock and act in unison, thereby
constituting a majority, the other 400 shares of stock
being held by the minority stockholders. Each stockholder
would usually have one vote for each share of
stock owned by him, and therefore, if five directors
were to be elected under the usual method of voting,
those individuals composing the majority of the stockholders
would succeed in casting a majority of votes
for each of the five directors. This would leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
minority without representation upon the board. If,
however, cumulative voting were used, the minority
having a total of 2,000 votes (400 multiplied by 5,
the number of directors to be elected) could concentrate
2,000 votes upon one or two of their candidates
and this would probably insure the election of such
candidates to the board, thus giving the minority representation.
In the case of a non-stock or membership
corporation, each member has simply one vote
for directors or for other purposes. It may be noted
that the directors themselves, in their meetings, have
also one vote each and this is entirely independent of
the amount of stock which they may own in the corporation.
It should also be noted that the directors in
their meetings may not vote by proxy, but sometimes
the members of a membership corporation may vote
in this way. Voting by proxy is a usual practice in
stock corporations. A proxy is merely a power of attorney
or agency given in writing by one stockholder
whereby he authorizes another person as his proxy
to vote, at a corporate meeting, his shares of stock
in his place. A proxy should be in writing and in a
form in accordance with the statutes of the State involved,
and is often, but not necessarily, under seal.
A stockholder who has given a proxy may revoke it
whenever he chooses and this would prevent the
holder of the proxy from voting on it. This would
be entirely independent of whether the person giving
the proxy had by revoking it violated his contract
with the person to whom it was given. That contract
would be only a private matter between them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>VOTING TRUSTS.&mdash;The proxy principle is involved
in what are termed "voting trusts." These arrangements
involve the placing by a number of stockholders
of their stock in the hands of certain persons,
giving to the latter the right to vote on the stock; in
other words, it is a concentration of the stock of a
number of persons in the hands of one or a few persons.
The latter are termed "voting trustees." It is
necessary to consult the statutes of the various States
with regard to the legality of such voting trusts, but
they are generally permitted, with the restriction,
however, that the agreement under which the stock is
deposited with the voting trustee or trustees must be
in writing and that any stockholder may have the
right to deposit his stock with such trustee or trustees
and become a party to the voting trust. The
statutes also frequently limit the time during which
such a voting trust may continue.</p>

<p>ISSUE OF STOCK.&mdash;The stock of a corporation
is in theory issued for an amount of money or
property equal to the par value of the stock. In practice,
however, in many States there is no limitation
on the valuation which the promoters of a corporation
may put upon the property or rights which are
transferred to the corporation. The stock is regarded
as fully paid in if property transferred to it is transferred
as having the assumed value of the corporation's
capital, however little the property may actually
be worth. In other States, however, an official must approve
the valuation put upon property transferred
as payment for stock, and in such States it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
assumed that the assets of a corporation when it begins
business represent at least approximately the
amount of its capital stock; even in such States, however,
there is no difficulty in promoting a corporation
which shall have a large capital though its property
is of slight value. All that is necessary is to incorporate
under the laws of another State which allows
greater freedom. Corporations organized in one
State are in general allowed to do business in other
States; so that a corporation which is intended to
carry on business in New York, may be incorporated
in another State, where it is not expected to do business.</p>

<p>PROCEDURE IN ISSUING BONDS.&mdash;It is
sometimes difficult for the investor fully to appreciate
the vast amount of detail work involved in the bringing
out of a new bond issue. Before the investment
banker underwrites the issue, or makes his purchase
from the corporation&mdash;before the bonds are offered to
the public&mdash;there is always a painstaking and minute
investigation of the new security from many different
viewpoints, made by and in behalf of the banker. The
investor can never know from the banker's printed
circular, descriptive of the issue, the great amount of
original work which underlies it and of which it is a
meager reflection. The circular is a summary of the
banker's investigation; it contains the salient features
of the issue and of the issuing corporation, reduced
to terms that are intelligible to the average layman.
It is a statement of the principal facts which led
the banker to make an investigation of the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
and upon which investigation he bases his
recommendation of the security offered by him to his
clients.</p>

<p>WHAT IS A BOND?&mdash;This can be explained
best by comparing it with a real estate bond and mortgage,
the nature of which has already been discussed.
When money is loaned on real estate, the mortgagor,
or the one who borrows, executes two papers in favor
of the mortgagee, or the lender. The first is either a
promissory note or a bond. The bond is a sealed writing
whereby the borrower binds himself, his heirs, administrators
or executors, or assigns, to pay the lender
a given sum of money at a specified time, together
with interest. The second paper given as security for
the note or bond, is a mortgage, which conveys the
title to the property to the lender, with the provision,
however, that if the borrower satisfies the conditions
imposed in the bond&mdash;that is, the payment of a certain
sum of money at a given time, together with interest
as agreed&mdash;this conveyance (mortgage) is to be held
null and void.</p>

<p>WHAT IS A CORPORATION INDENTURE?&mdash;The
indenture is a more lengthy instrument than
the bond, and, as will be noted, it is called an "indenture"
and not a "mortgage." The mortgage
strictly is only that portion of the indenture whereby
the property is conveyed or deeded to the mortgagee,
with the provision that the deed so given is to be held
null and void in the event that the conditions named
in the bond are faithfully carried out. The indenture
is broader than the mortgage; it contains provisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
other than those bearing directly on the mortgage.
An indenture is a sealed agreement between two or
more parties and any number of provisions may be
inserted in it, in addition to the mortgage clauses, as
may be deemed necessary or desirable. It is always
possible for the individual to obtain a loan secured by
a lien on his property, provided the security is good
and considered ample. If, however, his property was
of so great value that he desired to obtain a loan of
several millions of dollars, he would find it difficult,
or even impossible, to find any one person willing to
lend him so large an amount. If, however, the borrower
could find a number of persons who could and
would jointly contribute enough money to equal the
amount of the loan, he could divide this total amount
into equal parts and each lender could have such a
proportionate interest as might be desired. This, then,
is the case with large corporations, which are legalized
persons. Owing to the fact that the holders of
the bonds have only a fractional interest in the loan
and therefore in any property that may be pledged to
secure it, it is impossible to create separate mortgages
in favor of the individual bondholders on any particular
part of the property. No portion of the property
can be specifically designated&mdash;the interests of the
bondholders are in common. For this reason and
others, corporations are obliged to create what is
known as a Mortgage Deed of Trust&mdash;making the
mortgage to secure the many bonds in favor of some
responsible individual or trust company, who holds
it on behalf of the various bondholders in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
with the definite terms of the trust, and who is therefore
known as the Trustee. The indenture of the corporation
must in addition to covering the mortgage,
contain other related and necessary covenants, especially
as to the trust that must be created. As there
are so many covenants or provisions necessary in
order to fully protect all interests concerned, the corporation
indenture becomes bulky, but its form in
substance is not very different from that of the bond
and mortgage of the individual, which we have already
analyzed, and which for this reason it is well
for us to keep in mind as we follow the corporation
indenture.</p>

<p>ANALYSIS OF INDENTURES.&mdash;The indenture,
or agreement, must of necessity be made between
certain parties, the mortgagor or the corporation and
the mortgagee, in this case the Trustee who holds the
security given in trust for the various bondholders.
It is, therefore, proper that we recite at the very beginning
of the indenture the parties in interest, giving
their legal residence, or as in the case of corporations
the names of the States wherein they are incorporated.
It is quite essential that we know in what State
a corporation was incorporated, as its rights and privileges
are determined by the statutes of the State
which created it and by the charter which has been
granted to it. What are our reasons for creating the
indenture? The very first premise is that the corporation
is legally able to borrow money by law. If
it did not have this right we could proceed no further.
To borrow money and mortgage or pledge property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
as security therefor is a common law right of corporations,
but the amount which may be borrowed is
sometimes limited by State statutes. In the event
that the corporation desired to borrow in excess of the
limitation, additional capital stock is sometimes authorized
thereby creating a larger basis for borrowing.
If this premise is not incorporated, its omission
does not affect the status of the indenture, but it is
generally placed, as many other premises are, in the
indenture, for the sake of logic, and to show that the
matter has been considered, and that the fact is admitted
by the parties to the indenture. The purpose
for which the bonds are to be issued is sometimes duly
set forth, as for instance, to refund certain maturing
obligations, to construct a certain extension, to build
new terminals, etc. While the purpose may not always
be mentioned in the indenture, nevertheless it
must accord with the charter of the corporation and
the laws of the State. The company cannot exceed
the powers that have been granted to it. We next
want to know whether the authority to borrow money
and issue bonds therefor has been obtained in lawful
manner. Provisions covering the manner of securing
this authority will be found in the by-laws of the corporation,
and the counsel must examine this matter
carefully in order to see whether all legal formalities
have been strictly observed and whether the resolutions
are in proper order. There are certain essential
facts that must be stated in the bonds themselves and
which are elaborated in the covenants of the indenture.
These facts are embodied in the resolutions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the Board of Directors and of the stockholders and
are, therefore, incorporated in the premises of the
indenture. These facts include the total amount of
bonds authorized, title, denomination, form, date of
issue and maturity, rate of interest and where payable.
In order that there may be uniformity in the wording
and form of the bonds, so that no one holder will perchance
receive an undue advantage over any other
bondholder, the form of the bond, its coupons and
trustee's certificate must be duly set forth in the indenture.</p>

<p>LIMITATION OF POWERS OF DIRECTORS.&mdash;There
are various matters wherein directors
of any corporation do not usually have power to act
on behalf of the corporation without special authorization.
Such matters include the amendment of the
corporate charter (thereby changing the purposes of
the corporation), the change of the name of the corporation,
the increase or decrease of authorized capital
stock, the sale of the total corporate assets and
franchise, the consolidation of the corporation where
permitted by statute, and the giving of mortgages
upon the corporate property. This last point is especially
important since the validity of a corporate
mortgage as security for a loan of money depends
upon whether the mortgage was authorized and given
in all respects pursuant to statute of the State involved.
As these corporate mortgages not only are
given as security for a single loan of money but also
furnish security often for very large amounts of bonds,
the matter of the authority of the directors and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
validity of the mortgage becomes of great importance.
Therefore the statutes of the State involved must be
followed closely as to the procedure in connection
with the giving of a mortgage. It may be stated, however,
with regard to this matter and the other special
matters mentioned, the statutes generally provide
that some form of authorization should be obtained
from the stockholders, generally through their vote at
a special meeting called for that purpose, of which
proper notification and announcement have been
given; that some form of certificate as to the proceedings
at such meeting be made and filed by the secretary
and treasurer or other designated officer of the
corporation; that it should also be filed in the office
of the county clerk of the county involved and in the
office of the Secretary of State; and that some notification
of the act in question be also given to the
directors as well as the stockholders. It is, of course,
impossible to take up the details as to such matters,
the only safe course to pursue being to follow with
extreme care the statutes of the State wherein such
action is to be taken. From the foregoing, however,
the general purpose and effect of prevailing law may
be seen.</p>

<p>DIVIDENDS ON STOCK.&mdash;Dividends on the
stock of corporations are declared by the directors,
who have power to use their discretion as to the
amount to be disbursed in this way. The statutes
are, however, very explicit in prohibiting the declaration
of any dividends except out of the surplus profits
of the business conducted by the corporation. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
respect to dividends properly declared, the declaration
of the directors generally provides that they shall be
paid to all stockholders registered upon the books of
the company at a specified date in the future. Hence,
if a stockholder should sell or otherwise transfer his
stock, after that date to another person, the latter,
while becoming the owner of the stock, would not be
entitled to the dividend when paid. It would be payable
to the former stockholder, although he might,
pursuant to the agreement made with the person to
whom he sold the stock, turn over to the latter the
amount of the dividend.</p>

<p>CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS.&mdash;It frequently
happens that a corporation does not earn any dividends
in a particular year. The question arises, is the
holder of a 7% preferred stock in a position to demand
that the dividend be paid the following year.
Suppose the corporation earns nothing in 1921 and
earns 14% in 1922. The holder of one share of a
non-cumulative preferred stock would receive the
usual 7% dividend only in 1922. If the stock were
cumulative he would receive 14%. In other words
the unearned dividends accumulate and become a
charge which the corporation must pay when sufficient
is earned in prosperous years before the holders
of common stock are entitled to receive any dividend.
Usually the stock certificate and the articles of incorporation
specify whether stock is cumulative or non-cumulative.
If they do not, then reference to the law
of the State where the company is incorporated, is
necessary to decide such a question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>LIABILITY OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
TO THE CORPORATION.&mdash;Whether a corporation
becomes liable by virtue of action taken by
its officers or directors depends upon principles of
agency applied to the law of corporations. These
principles have already been stated. Whether the
directors or officers are themselves personally liable
is another matter. Conceivably they may be liable
either to their employer (the corporation) or to creditors
of the corporation. They are not directly liable
to the shareholders as such. Any injury or wrong
they may indirectly do to shareholders is directly done
to the corporation, the shareholders being injured
only because the corporation in which he is interested
is injured. Shareholders may, however, institute proceedings
against directors or officers if, as not infrequently
happens, the corporation itself, being controlled
by the wrongdoers, fails to take proceedings.
The shareholders in such a case, however, demand redress
for the corporation, not for themselves; and
whatever may be recovered, is recovered for the benefit
of the corporation. The duty of the directors and
officers of the corporation is analogous to the duty of
any agent to his principal. That is, each officer or
director must exercise reasonable diligence in the performance
of his work and must observe fidelity to his
principal. The application of these principles to particular
fact is not always easy, but the principles
themselves are plain. Especially the degree of care
which directors are bound to use presents a troublesome
question of fact. In a small business it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the duty of a director to take active control of the
policy of the company and supervise with some minuteness
each business operation. Such direction is
impossible where a great railroad or industrial corporation
is concerned. In such a case directors necessarily
derive their information from subordinate
agents and cannot investigate facts for themselves.
Directors are not liable for mistakes of judgment if
they use reasonable care; if, however, they wilfully
do an act which they know is not authorized by the
charter or by-laws of the corporation, they will be
liable for the consequences. Directors who are cognizant
of wrongs committed by their co-directors and
fail to take available measures to prevent the wrongs,
become liable themselves. Directors may terminate
their liability for future acts by resigning, but resignation
will not destroy liability for acts already done
even though the resulting damage does not happen
until after resignation. The corporation requires that
a director or other officer shall not act on behalf of
the corporation in a matter in which he has a personal
interest at variance with that of the corporation.
Should matters of this sort arise, as they often do,
the interested officer or director should not take part
in the decision of the question, and may render himself
liable if he does so.</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF OFFICERS TO CREDITORS.&mdash;So
long as a corporation is solvent, creditors
of the corporation have no reason or right to seek
redress from any one but the corporation itself. Creditors
of an insolvent corporation, however, may enjoin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
action by the company's officers which is unauthorized
or likely to prove detrimental to the assets of the corporation.
If the officers knowingly misapply the assets
of an insolvent corporation they are personally
liable to the creditors for the injury caused thereby.
They are liable sometimes by statute, but also even
apart from statute, for false statements of the condition
of the corporation in reliance upon which credit
is given the corporation. Like other agents, the officers
of a corporation impliedly warrant to persons
with whom they deal their authority to do the acts
which they undertake; and if authority is lacking, they
are liable personally. The only qualification of this
principle is that if the facts from which authority, or
lack of it, may be determined, are known to the person
dealing with them, they are not liable; that is, they
do not warrant the correctness of an inference of authority
from known facts.</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF BANK OFFICERS.&mdash;The
principles governing the liability of bank directors and
other officers of a bank are the same as those which
govern similar questions regarding other corporations.
The bank laws, however, impose certain duties
and penalties which affect the application of general
principles. It may be worth while to enumerate
briefly some of the duties of different bank officers,
a violation of which renders them personally liable.
As to directors it has been said that "It is not necessary
to show directly that the directors actually had
their attention called to the mismanagement of the
affairs of the bank, or to the misconduct of subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
officers. It is sufficient to show that the evidence
of the management or misconduct were such that it
must have been brought to their knowledge unless
they were grossly negligent or wilfully careless in
the discharge of their duties." They are liable for
the consequences not only of their own fraud but of
their ultra vires acts. They are liable for approving
the discount of notes known to be worthless or of
so doubtful value as to be obviously unsafe. If guilty
of negligence in failing to discover that such paper
was worthless they may also be liable. They are
guilty of negligence and may thereby render themselves
liable if they wholly neglect to ascertain the
condition of the bank from its books, though a thorough
examination of the books of a bank, especially
of one transacting a large business, cannot be expected
of every director; and the law would require
no more than would be demanded by the standard of
reasonableness.</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT.&mdash;The duties of the president,
and consequently his liabilities, must be determined
by general law, the charter of the particular
institution, its by-laws, and by general business
usage. Thus, if the usage exists for the president to
draw and sign checks in the absence of the cashier,
the president will have authority so to act. He has
authority to conduct the litigation of the bank; he
may employ counsel. He may generally indorse negotiable
paper of the bank. On the other hand, he
will be personally liable if he permits improper loans
or over-drafts; if he fails to give proper instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
to inferior officers; if it is his duty to require a bond
from an inferior officer, and he fails to do so; and,
generally, if he commits a breach of duty to the corporation
which causes damage. He has no power
to execute deeds of real estate without authority of
the directors and, generally, an instrument which
must be executed under the seal of the bank must be
authorized by the board. The discount of negotiable
paper also is a duty of the directors.</p>

<p>THE CASHIER.&mdash;The Supreme Court of Maine
has thus expressed the functions of the cashier of a
bank: "A cashier, it is well known, is allowed to present
himself to the public as habitually accustomed
to make payment for its bills or notes payable to
other persons; to make payment for bills and notes
discounted by the directors; to receive payment for
bills of exchange, notes, and other debts due to the
bank; to receive money on deposit and to pay the
same to the order of the depositors. He is presented
as having the custody of its books, bills of exchange,
notes, and other evidences of debt due to it, and, indeed,
of all its movable property; as making entry
in its books and as keeping its accounts and a record
of its proceedings. In many banks these duties are
performed in part by tellers, clerks, or assistants, but
generally, it is believed, under his superintendence,
and he might at any time assume the performance of
them and perform them, if able to do so, without such
assistance. His true position appears to be that of a
general agent for the performance of his official and
accustomed duties. While acting within the scope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
of this authority he would bind the bank, although he
might violate his private instructions." He must exercise
proper oversight over subordinate officers; he
must use reasonable care and skill. He may become
liable personally for failure to observe instructions
as to a special deposit; for the improper sale of stock
held as security for a loan; for improperly making
loans, for failure to give essential information to the
directors; for failing to exercise proper oversight
over inferior officers or agents, as well as in the more
obvious case where he has taken advantage of his
position to commit intentional fraud upon the bank.</p>

<p>BLUE SKY LAWS.&mdash;The term "blue sky" has
become very familiar to the corporation lawyer in the
last few years. The so-called "blue sky" legislation is
a well meaning, if partly futile, attempt to meet an existing
evil in connection with the sale of corporate
securities. We shall find later that five elements are
necessary to constitute the action of fraud or deceit:
(1) a false representation of a material fact; (2) made
with knowledge of its falsity; (3) with intent that it
be acted upon; (4) that it be acted upon; (5) damage
follows. The courts have almost universally held that
a mere statement of opinion does not give rise to a
cause of action for fraud, whereas a mistatement of
fact does. Hence if I state to you when selling you
100 shares of the Bonanza Gold Mining Corporation
that the company has never paid less than 20% in
dividends during the last five years and you purchase
the stock relying on this misrepresentation of fact (the
situation actually being the company has never paid a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
dividend) you would have a cause of action in deceit
against me. If, however, I had simply said in selling
you the stock that the outlook for the company was
the brightest in its history, that the president had told
me that dividends of 30% a year were assured indefinitely
and that this stock was by far the best bargain
which had been on the market in over a year, although
I know when I made such statements that there was
little or nothing to substantiate them, nevertheless, I
would not be liable in deceit. My statements were
merely matters of opinion or what we call "seller's
talk" or "puffing one's wares."</p>

<p>THE FINANCIAL PROSPECTUS.&mdash;If you
will examine the average financial prospectus of a new
stock being offered for sale to the public, you will find
that when most of the high sounding terms and flattering
statements are analyzed carefully that they
will fall in this second class of non-actionable statements.
There are few statements of fact but many
glowing statements in the nature of "seller's talk."
We all know, however, that enormous quantities of
worthless stock are sold each year by this method.
When business conditions are good it sometimes
seems as if the wilder the scheme the easier it is to
find a gullible public ready to purchase such securities.
To prevent the perpetration of such frauds on
the public is the object of the so-called "blue sky"
legislation.</p>

<p>THE LAW ANALYZED.&mdash;The first "blue sky"
law was passed in Kansas in 1911. The evil sought to
be remedied was so prevalent that the idea spread rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
and now similar legislation, of one type or another,
has been enacted in a majority of the States.
Some of the acts are crude, some have been held unconstitutional,
and many are difficult of enforcement.
Recently, however, more care has been taken in drafting
such legislation, and many of the earlier laws will
undoubtedly be amended to conform with this later
legislation. We may take the Illinois statute of 1919
as a good sample of a drastic yet fairly workable Act.
The law may be briefly considered from three standpoints:
(1) the persons affected; (2) the securities
affected; (3) the penalties provided for violation of
its provisions.</p>

<p>AS TO THE PERSONS AFFECTED.&mdash;Generally
any person offering any securities, and any seller's
agent or broker, the issuer, or any agent or director
of the issuer, or any owner or dealer, is covered by
the Act. Illinois fiscal corporations such as banks,
trust companies, insurance companies, building and
loan associations and the like are practically exempt
from the provisions of the Illinois securities law.</p>

<p>THE ILLINOIS ACT.&mdash;The Illinois act covers
the following securities:</p>

<p>Section 3. For the purposes of this Act securities
are divided into four classes as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Securities, the inherent qualities of which
assure their sale and disposition without the perpetration
of fraud, which shall be known as securities in
Class "A";</p>

<p>(2) Securities, the inherent qualities of which, or
in the nature of one or both parties to the sale thereof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
assure their sale and disposition without the perpetration
of fraud, which shall be known as securities in
Class "B";</p>

<p>(3) Securities based on established income, which
shall be known as securities in Class "C";</p>

<p>(4) Securities based on prospective income,
which shall be known as securities in Class "D";</p>

<p>Section 4. Securities in Class "A" shall comprise
securities:</p>

<p>(1) Issued by a government or governmental
agency, or by anybody having power of taxation of
assessment;</p>

<p>(2) Issued by any National or State bank or trust
company, building and loan association of this State,
or insurance company organized or under the supervision
of the Department of Trade and Commerce of
this State;</p>

<p>(3) Issued by any corporation operating any
public utility in any State wherein there is or was at
the time of issuance thereof in effect any law regulating
such utilities and the issue of securities by such
corporation;</p>

<p>(4) Appearing in any list of securities dealt in on
the New York, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh, Cleveland or Detroit Stock Exchange,
respectively, pursuant to official authorization
by such exchanges, respectively, and securities senior
to any securities so appearing;</p>

<p>(5) Whereof current prices shall have been
quoted from time to time for not less than one year
next preceding the offering for sale thereof, in tabulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
market reports published as news items, and not

find himself in a position where he has violated one of
these laws with their severe penalties.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
Transfer of Stock</h2>


<p>UNIFORM TRANSFER OF STOCK.&mdash;Turn
now to an entirely different matter, the transfer
of stock. A stock certificate is one of the
quasi-negotiable instruments of commerce, at common
law not fully negotiable like bills and notes, but,
nevertheless, having some of the attributes of negotiability,
especially in States where what is called the
Uniform Transfer of Stock Act has been enacted.
This statute applies only to corporations of those
States which have passed the statute.</p>

<p>TWO METHODS OF TRANSFERRING
STOCK.&mdash;Stock may be transferred in two ways:
first, by delivery of the certificate with the indorsement
upon it of the owner of the stock, indicating
that he assigns or authorizes the assignment of the
stock, and second, by delivery of the certificate, with
a separate document of assignment attached stating
that the owner of the certificate assigns or authorizes
the transfer of the stock. This second method
is not so completely good as the first, where the
assignment is on the certificate itself, because if for
any reason the separate document should become
detached from the certificate, the transferee's right
would not be apparent, and therefore the Transfer
of Stock Act provides that if a purchaser should get
possession of the stock certificate with an indorsement
upon it, he would take precedence over even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
prior assignee who had a separate paper assigning
the certificate to him. Of course, after the transfer
is duly registered on the books of the company, then
it makes no difference whether that transfer was secured
by means of a separate power or assignment
or by means of one written on the certificate itself.</p>

<p>EFFECT OF TRANSFER ON THE BOOKS
OF THE COMPANY.&mdash;What is the effect of transfer
on the books of the company? Under the common
law, stock was originally transferable just like
any intangible right, merely by agreement of the
parties, to which requirement was added, as a necessity
when stock certificates became common, the delivery
of the certificate itself. But it was convenient
for the company to know who was owner of its stock.
It was inconvenient to have stockholders buy and sell
without any notice to the company, and therefore a
common by-law was that stock should be transferred
only on the books of the company. The Uniform
Transfer of Stock Act goes back partially to the old
rule, since the transfer of the certificate with the indorsement
or separate assignment is what transfers
the stock, not the transfer on the books of the company;
but in order that the corporation may not be
inconvenienced it is provided that the corporation
shall have the right to pay dividends to any one registered
on the books of the company, such persons
being the apparent owners, and that only such persons
have the right to vote. An analogous custom
that shows the importance of registration of stock
transfers on the books of the company is the registry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of deeds in the transfer of real estate. It is the deed,
not the record of it, which creates a title, but an unrecorded
deed may be defeated by creditors or purchasers
without notice, so that to protect himself
fully the owner of land is obliged to record his deed.</p>

<p>OWNERSHIP OF STOCK, INDIVIDUALLY,
IN COMMON, JOINTLY AND BY FIDUCIARIES.&mdash;Stock
may be owned by a man individually,
it may be owned by several persons in
common, or it may be owned by several persons jointly,
or it may be owned by a person in a fiduciary capacity,
as trustee, executor or guardian. What is the
difference, may be asked, between the case of ownership
of stock by several persons in common and
ownership by several persons jointly. The common
law drew this distinction between joint right and
rights merely held in common; that a joint right survived
to the survivors when one of them died, whereas
a right held in common passed, on the death of one
of the owners, pro rata to the personal representatives
of the deceased. Therefore if A, B and C own
stock jointly, when C dies A and B are the owners.
If A, B and C own the stock in common, A, B and the
executors of C would own it on the death of C. Generally
where several persons own a right now, they
own it in common, but there are two notable exceptions&mdash;the
case of partnerships and the case of trustees.
Stock held in the name of A, B and C, when
A, B and C are either partners or trustees, will pass
to A and B on the death of C. C's executor will not
have to join in the transfer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSFER AFFECT
PURCHASER AND ALSO CORPORATION.&mdash;The
difficulties in the transfer of stock may be looked
at (1) from the standpoint of a purchaser of the stock,
including within the name of purchaser one who lends
money on the stock as well as one who buys it, and
(2) from the standpoint of the corporation whose
duty it is to transfer the stock on its books. Generally
the difficulties which confront the purchaser
are the same which confront the corporation when it
is asked to transfer. If the purchaser should get a
defective right when he bought, then the corporation,
if it should transfer, would generally get into trouble
also.</p>

<p>LEGAL AND EQUITABLE DIFFICULTIES
IN TRANSFERS.&mdash;The main difficulties which arise
may be divided into legal and equitable difficulties.
By legal difficulties are meant cases in which the purchaser
will not get a good legal title. By equitable
difficulties, cases in which the purchaser will get a
good legal title but which will be subject to an equitable
right in favor of some other person. The person
who has an equitable right cannot reclaim the stock
from one who is, or succeeds to the rights of, a bona
fide purchaser for value without notice.</p>

<p>LEGAL DIFFICULTIES&mdash;FORGED CERTIFICATE.&mdash;First,
in regard to legal difficulties.
The certificate of stock may be forged. The purchaser
of a forged certificate of stock, of course, gets
nothing in the way of stock. He does get the right,
however, to sue the person who sold him the stock on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
an implied warranty of genuineness. Analogous to
the situation of the purchaser is the situation of the
corporation if, on receiving a forged certificate with
a request for a transfer, it should transfer ownership
on the books, completing the transfer by issuing a
new certificate; for any person who took the new certificate,
even though he was a bona fide purchaser for
value, would not get any stock in the corporation, if
all authorized stock had previously been issued. The
corporation has no power to overissue stock; it cannot
emit any more even if it tries, and therefore
the purchaser gets no stock. He does, however, get
a right against the corporation. The corporation has
issued what purports to be new stock to him, or if
he is a remote purchaser he has paid for stock in reliance
on a certificate which the corporation has issued.
The corporation is estopped, as the legal
phrase is, to deny the validity of that certificate as
against one who has thus relied on its acts. The result
is that the corporation is bound to pay to him
value equivalent to that of real stock, because the
corporation has put out something which seems to
be good stock, and owing to the act of the corporation
the purchaser has been deceived.</p>

<p>FORGED ASSIGNMENTS.&mdash;A second legal
difficulty arises where the indorsement or assignment
of the certificate is forged. Only the owner of stock
can sell it. Consequently, if anybody else attempts
by forgery or otherwise to make a transfer, the transfer
will be ineffectual. The result will be the same as
though the whole certificate were forged. The purchaser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
under the forged indorsement will get nothing.
If the corporation relies on the forged indorsement
and issues a new certificate, it will, in the same
way as in the case of a new certificate issued for a
wholly forged one, be liable to a purchaser for value.
It is, of course, of vital importance, therefore, to make
sure that indorsements are correct, and generally it
is desirable to take indorsed certificates only from
reliable persons. If you take such a certificate from
a reliable person, even though there is no express
guaranty of signatures by a brokerage house or other
third person, as there often is, you will be practically
safe because of the implied warranty of genuineness
by the seller which applies to the indorsement on certificates
as well as to cases of wholly forged certificates.</p>

<p>ASSIGNMENTS BY UNAUTHORIZED
AGENT.&mdash;A third case is where the indorsement is
made by an agent, and the agent has no authority to
act. A corporation transferring stock should require,
and a purchaser should require, the clearest evidence
of an agent's authority if the signature of the transferor
is made by an agent. It is not only necessary
to be sure that the agent's authority originally existed,
but it is necessary to be sure that his power has
not been revoked, either by the death of the principal
or by express revocation during his life. A question
that sometimes is troublesome, in regard to the agent's
authority to make such an indorsement, arises where
the terms of the power given the agent are general;
where he is authorized to do a very broad class of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
acts for the principal, but no specific mention is made
of the particular certificate which he seeks to transfer.
Such a power, if it certainly includes the transfer
of that certificate, is legally good, but a corporation
would object to make a transfer under a power which
did not specifically mention the particular certificate,
unless it was absolutely certain from its terms that
this certificate in question was included.</p>

<p>LACK OF CAPACITY TO ASSIGN.&mdash;A fourth
case is lack of capacity on the part of the owner of the
stock to make a transfer. This lack of capacity may
arise from a variety of causes, insanity or infancy,
for instance. A totally insane person is as incapable
of transferring stock as of transferring other property.
An infant, that is, a minor, though not wholly
without capacity, if not under guardianship, becomes,
presumably, wholly without capacity to transfer stock
if under guardianship. An elderly person under the
charge of a conservator would be incapacitated to
transfer his property. An infant who has had no guardian
appointed, though he could make a transfer, could
also, by virtue of his infant's privilege, revoke that
transfer, which, therefore, would be too insecure
either for a purchaser to take or for a corporation to
allow. If stock is owned by an infant, a purchaser or
a corporation should require that a guardian be appointed
and that the transfer be made by the guardian.</p>

<p>LACK OF DELIVERY&mdash;THEFT OF CERTIFICATE.&mdash;A
fifth case is where the signature on
the back of the certificate of stock is genuine, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
where there has been no valid delivery by the owner.
This is rather a troublesome case to detect. In the
case of full negotiable instruments, like bills and
notes, if the signature of an indorser is genuine, a
purchaser for value of the instrument will get title
even though he purchases from a thief, or though for
any reason there was no intention on the part of the
owner who wrote his name on the back to make a
transfer of the instrument. But by the common law
stock certificates were not negotiable to this extent.
This case occurred in a law office in Boston: the
head of the firm rather carelessly kept "street certificates"
for stock (that is, certificates made out in the
name of the brokerage firm which was the former
owner and indorsed in blank), not having the certificates
transferred to his own name. The stock was
not at the time dividend-paying, so that a transfer
on the books seemed unimportant. He put the certificates
into the office safe to which the office boy had
access. This boy took the certificates and sold them
through a broker, and the loss was not discovered for
several years. After it was discovered the loss was
traced by the numbers of the certificates, and action
was brought against the brokers who were unfortunate
enough to have taken the stock from the office
clerk. Now, if the certificates had been negotiable
paper, the brokers would not have been liable, but
under the law then existing it seemed so probable
that they were liable that they settled the case by paying
more than half the value of the stock. The only
thing that could have prevented their being liable was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
that, under the circumstances, the contention was possible
that the owner of the stock had been so negligent
in his dealing with the certificates as to preclude
him from asserting any right. Now the Transfer of
Stock Act changes the law in this respect so far as
Massachusetts stock certificates are concerned. The
act makes them fully negotiable, but the common law
would apparently still apply to certificates of stock of
corporations incorporated in other States. And similar
principles would be applicable in other States
which have passed the same statute.</p>

<p>DEATH OF OWNER OF INDORSED CERTIFICATE.&mdash;A
somewhat similar case is this: suppose
that after the owner of stock has written his
name on the back of it, he dies; that is a common
enough case. Many men have used their stock certificates
to borrow money on, and therefore, after paying
the loan they have them in their possession with
their signatures on the back. They put those certificates
back in their safe deposit boxes. Then suppose
the owner dies and an attempt is made to transfer
the stock by virtue of that signature written on the
certificate. That is not a valid transfer at common
law. The certificate was owned only up to the time
of his death by the man whose name is on the face;
on his death his executor becomes the owner and the
executor's signature is necessary to transfer the title,
and the signature of the man himself written before
his death is not effective for that purpose; and yet a
purchaser may not be aware that that signature is
invalid; he may not know that the man who signed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
it is dead, and similarly the corporation may allow
the transfer to go through in ignorance that the signer
is dead. If the money which is the proceeds of the
stock actually reaches the executor of the estate, of
course he could not object to the validity of the transfer,
and he could not object if he were in any way a
party to the transfer of the stock by means of the
signature of the dead man; but if the proceeds did not
get to the hands of the executor and he was in no way
responsible for the transfer, he could assert that the
transfer was invalid and that that stock belonged to
him. This, again, is changed by the uniform law so
far as applies to corporations in the States which have
enacted that law. To avoid misapprehension it should
be said that if an indorsed certificate has been delivered
for value by the owner, during his lifetime, to a
purchaser or lender, the death of the indorser does not
impair the validity of the signature even at common
law. The purchase of the stock or a loan made
on the stock gives the purchaser or lender a
power which cannot be revoked by death or otherwise.</p>

<p>BANKRUPTCY OF THE OWNER OF STOCK.&mdash;One
other important case, in which a genuine
signature of one who was the owner cannot
transfer a good title, is the case of bankruptcy. The
Federal bankruptcy law provides absolutely that title
to property which a bankrupt has at the time of his
bankruptcy shall be vested in his trustee. If, therefore,
after A's bankruptcy, A seeks to transfer stock
which he had owned, and which was in his own name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
he cannot do so, for he is no longer the owner of the
stock, and he has no power to transfer it. Therefore,
even a bona fide purchaser from a bankrupt will
get nothing.</p>

<p>ATTACHMENT OF STOCK.&mdash;A sixth difficulty
in regard to transfer of stock&mdash;attachment of the
stock by a creditor of the registered owner&mdash;is eliminated
in States where the Uniform Transfer Act has
been enacted. Such attachments created considerable
difficulty before the passage of the act. Suppose this
case: A is the owner on the books of the company of
100 shares of Boston &amp; Albany stock. He knows a
creditor is about to attach that stock, and in order to
get ahead of the creditor he sells the stock on the exchange.
If he makes the sale before the attachment,
undoubtedly the sale everywhere would prevail over
the subsequent attachment; but suppose the attachment
preceded by a little while the sale of the stock.
A still has the certificate, and brokers and purchasers
are accustomed to rely on the certificate as evidence of
ownership. They take the certificate and pay A
money for it; then when the purchaser goes to transfer
the stock he finds that an attachment has been
put upon the books of the company. Where the uniform
law governs the case the only way to make an
attachment of stock effective is to seize the certificate
itself. But in other States this difficulty may still
arise, of a purchaser being deceived by the certificate
itself, and paying money on the faith of it when there
has been an attachment levied by a creditor immediately
before on the books of the company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>TRANSFERS BETWEEN HUSBAND AND
WIFE.&mdash;One other matter of transfer deserves attention,
and that is a transfer between husband and
wife, or wife and husband. A married woman can
contract in most States as fully as a married man, but
generally, though not universally, neither of them
can contract with the other or make a conveyance directly
to the other. A promissory note from wife to
husband, or husband to wife, or any other conveyance
or transfer or contract was at common law and still
is in many States invalid. A husband can, however,
appoint his wife his agent, and a wife can appoint her
husband her agent, and when such an agent acts, his
act will be legally that of the principal, just as in any
other case of agency. Accordingly, if a husband
draws a check payable to his wife, though he does not
become liable as drawer to his wife, and could not be
sued by her if the check was not paid, the bank runs
no risk in paying the check because the husband has
authorized the bank to make a payment to the wife.
Similarly, if a husband authorizes a corporation to
transfer stock to his wife it seems that the corporation
is protected, having acted under the authority of
the owner, and that the wife would get a good title to
the stock. This question has, however, been somewhat
disputed by lawyers. Therefore it is very probable
that a corporation would, as a matter of precaution,
refuse to run any risk by transferring directly
from husband to wife or vice versa, but would require
that the transfer should be made through a third person
in any State where husband and wife cannot contract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
with one another. So much for difficulties arising
out of defects caused by the lack of legal title to
the stock.</p>

<p>STOCK HELD IN TRUST.&mdash;Now let us consider
equitable defects. Such defects chiefly arise
where stock is held in trust. It would be the simplest
and pleasantest thing for a corporation if it could refuse
to register stock in trust at all, but it has been
decided that it cannot do this, that it is bound, if requested,
to register stock in favor of a trustee and
issue stock to trustees. Now trustees hold under an
appointment by the court. A trustee may cease to be
such at any time by removal of the court as well as by
death. Suppose stock in the name of D, trustee. If
D has ceased to be trustee because he has been removed
from office, a transfer by him will not be valid.
Accordingly, it is essential for a corporation and for
a purchaser to be certain, not simply that D was trustee,
but that D is trustee at the time he attempts to
make the transfer. We may suppose the case of a
certificate which does not state that there is a trust.
Not infrequently trustees, to avoid complications, do
not specify in the certificate that they are trustees.
If the corporation or if the purchaser of that stock
has no notice that D is really holding that stock in
trust, the corporation or the purchaser will have the
same rights as if there were no trust. But if either
the corporation or the purchaser learns, from extrinsic
sources, that the stock is really held in trust,
they will be bound to make certain that the seller is
still empowered to act as trustee, in the same way as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
if the certificate specifically stated on its face that
the stock was owned by D in the capacity of trustee.</p>

<p>ONE HAVING NOTICE THAT STOCK
IS HELD IN TRUST MUST ASCERTAIN THE
TERMS OF THE TRUST.&mdash;Even if the supposed
trustee is actually the trustee he may not have power
to give a good title to the stock. He has the legal
title, undoubtedly, but if the certificate contains notice
that he holds the legal title as trustee, every one is
bound at his peril when purchasing the stock, and also
the corporation is bound at its peril before it allows
the transfer of the stock, to make sure that the trustee
is authorized by the terms of his trust to transfer
the stock.</p>

<p>A TRUSTEE HAS POWERS NECESSARY
TO CARRY OUT TERMS OF TRUST.&mdash;Generally
when a transfer of stock is attempted by a trustee it
means that the trustee is selling the stock, though that
is not necessarily the case. A trust may be terminated;
that is, a trust may be created for twenty years,
with directions to the trustee to transfer the trust
property at the end of twenty years to certain beneficiaries.
A transfer by the trustee at the close of the
twenty years to the beneficiaries would not be a sale
of the stock; it would be a transfer for the purpose of
carrying out the trust, and a trustee always has implied
power to make any transfer of stock that is
necessary to carry out the purpose of the trust.</p>

<p>A TRUSTEE HAS NO IMPLIED POWER
TO SELL.&mdash;A trustee has no implied power to sell.
The general duty of a trustee is to keep the property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
which is left to him in trust or conveyed to him in
trust in its existing form, and no power is implied to
change the form to something else. Accordingly, if
no power to sell is in terms given in a trust created by
deed or will, a corporation will require, and a purchaser
should require, the trustee to obtain the authority
of the probate court to make the sale. Carefully
drawn trusts generally contain a power for the
trustee to sell if the purpose of the trust is to produce
an income-bearing fund for a long period of years.
For that purpose a change of investment is frequently
desirable, and therefore trustees are expressly given
that power. But the corporation which has issued a
certificate to a trustee and a purchaser from the trustee
must find out at their peril whether such a power
is given.</p>

<p>A TRUSTEE HAS NO IMPLIED POWER
TO PLEDGE.&mdash;Another power, and one which is not
commonly given, is the power to borrow on stock, to
pledge it or use it for collateral security. Such a
power is not implied and is not commonly given in
trust deeds or wills. Therefore, a bank or other lender
should not lend on certificates of stock which are
made out to the borrower as trustee, or made out to
any one as trustee. Of course, it is improper, even
though the trust did give power to borrow, to allow
the trustee not only to borrow money on trust securities
but to use the money borrowed as part of his own
assets; that is, to put it in his own general account.
It is his duty to keep trust money separate, and therefore
if the trustee has power to borrow he should keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
the funds which he borrows earmarked as trust property;
but as has been said, he will rarely have power
given him expressly to borrow even for trust purposes.</p>

<p>A TRUSTEE CANNOT TRANSFER TO
HIMSELF.&mdash;Suppose a trustee is by a deed or will
given power to sell and he asks the corporation to
make a transfer of the stock to himself. The corporation
should not do it. He has power to sell to any one
else but himself. A fiduciary cannot make a bargain
with himself in regard to his trust property, and
therefore he should not be allowed to transfer the
stock to himself.</p>

<p>A TRUSTEE CANNOT DELEGATE HIS
POWER TO SELL.&mdash;A trustee cannot delegate his
powers, and therefore he cannot give a general power
of attorney to another, to sell trust stock or any trust
property whenever it may seem wise to the agent to
do so. Even though the trustee has himself power to
sell, he must exercise his own discretion as to the occasion
when it is proper to sell.</p>

<p>PURCHASER FROM A TRUSTEE IS NOT
BOUND TO SEE TO APPLICATION OF PURCHASE
MONEY.&mdash;Though the corporation and
though the purchaser from a trustee are bound to see,
if they have notice of the trust by the form of the certificate,
that the trustee is not making an unauthorized
sale, neither the purchaser nor the corporation is
bound to see that the trustee does not make an improper
application of the money received from sale of
trust stock. In the current legal phrase, neither the
purchaser nor the corporation is bound to see to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
application of the trust money; but if either the purchaser
or the corporation had notice of a proposed
misapplication of the trust money to be received for
the stock, it would be improper to allow the transfer
knowing that the proceeds would be misapplied, and
the corporation or the purchaser would be liable if
the transfer was carried out.</p>

<p>AN EXECUTOR HAS IMPLIED POWER
TO SELL.&mdash;Stock held by a guardian or by an executor
is in many respects treated similarly to stock
held by a trustee. There is this difference, however,
in the executor's position, that as it is his duty to reduce
the estate to cash he has in most, but not all
States, an implied power to sell; it does not have to be
given to him in the will. The will, however, may restrict
an executor's right to sell certain stock, and
therefore even in the case of an executor it would be
proper for a corporation to make sure that the executor's
power had not been restricted by the will
before allowing the transfer.</p>

<p>TRANSFER BY AN EXECUTOR TO A LEGATEE.&mdash;Generally
the executor will seek to reduce
the property to cash and therefore seek to transfer
the stock in the estate to a purchaser, but he may try
to transfer it directly to a legatee. He may himself
be a legatee and endeavor to transfer to himself. Unless
he is a residuary legatee or a legatee of the specific
stock in question it is as improper for him to transfer
to himself as for a trustee to transfer to himself. Even
though the executor is a pecuniary legatee or is entitled
to payment for commissions, he would have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
right to take stock in lieu of such pecuniary legacy or
commission, for he cannot make such a bargain with
himself though he might in regard to the legacy of
another. If the executor is a specific or residuary legatee
the question of a right to transfer to himself is
the same as to transfer to any other legatee, and that
right is only subject to one qualification. Creditors
of an estate have the first right; legatees do not get
their legacies paid unless creditors are taken care of
first. Creditors have a fixed period from the time
when executors or administrators give bonds within
which to assert their claims. If they have not asserted
their claims in that period the claims are barred.
After that time has expired it is generally known
whether the assets of the estate are sufficient to pay
legacies, and it is usually then proper to allow a
transfer to a legatee. Prior to that you run the risk&mdash;which
may be in a particular case a very small one or
it may be a very large one&mdash;that the creditors of the
estate may exhaust the assets and the legatees not be
entitled to anything.</p>

<p>LOST CERTIFICATES.&mdash;Occasionally a
question arises in regard to a lost certificate. The
Uniform Law provides for this case in substantially
the same way as the common law would deal with it
if there were no statute, namely, the corporation may
demand a bond to indemnify it before it issues a new
certificate. This bond is essential because should the
old certificate turn up and be transferred to a bona
fide purchaser for value, the corporation would be
liable on the old certificate, and as it would also be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
liable to a purchaser for value of the new certificate it
is necessary that it should have a bond to protect it.</p>

<p>INTERPLEADER OF SEVERAL CLAIMANTS
FOR STOCK.&mdash;If there are several claimants
for stock, as sometimes happens, the corporation
should file a bill of interpleader, as it is called, against
the several claimants, asking the court to determine
which one is rightfully entitled. An instance of that
kind would be where A asks a corporation to transfer
stock to him, presenting a certificate indorsed by B,
but B notifies the corporation that he has been defrauded
out of that stock by A, and that he elects to
rescind the transfer to A and demands the certificate
back. The corporation cannot undertake to determine
which of these parties is in the right; it must ask
the court to do so. Not infrequently the same situation
arises in a bank where money has been lent on
stock, and notice is given to the bank not to return
that security to the borrower because he obtained it
fraudulently or otherwise has acted in violation of the
rights of a third person in pledging it to the bank.
The bank, if it is a bona fide lender, is, of course, entitled
to hold the stock for its own security so far as
it may be necessary to repay the loan; but perhaps the
bank can get the loan repaid out of other securities unquestionably
belonging to the borrower. In that
event the bank should do so and then ask the court
who is entitled to the disputed stock.</p>

<p>EFFECT OF DELIVERING UNINDORSED
CERTIFICATE.&mdash;In order to transfer stock, as previously
said, it is necessary that the stock should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
either indorsed or that on a separate paper an assignment
or power to transfer should be written. What
is the effect of giving a certificate without either of
these formalities? It virtually protects the person
who receives the certificate, for though he has not
title to the stock and cannot get title without an indorsement,
he has the certificate in his possession
which prevents any other person from getting title;
and, furthermore, he has the right to require an indorsement
from the person whose indorsement is
needed, provided, of course, that the holder of the certificate
took it from the owner, who impliedly or expressly
agreed that he should have title. If somebody
not an owner of a certificate delivered it without indorsement
to a bank, and borrowed money on it, the
bank would not be protected. The true owner could
say, "That is mine," and take it away.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
Personal Property</h2>


<p>PROPERTY DEFINED.&mdash;Property in the strict
legal sense, is the aggregate of rights which one
may lawfully exercise over particular things to
the exclusion of others. "If a man were alone in the
world," says Kant, "he could properly hold or acquire
nothing as his own; because between himself, as Person,
and all other outward objects, as Things, there
is no relation. The relation is between him and other
people, whom he excludes from the thing." All things
are not the subject of property, because, the sea,
the air, light, and similar things, cannot be appropriated.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;An illustration that gives
us the idea of property will make our definition clear.
A takes his shoes to a cobbler to be repaired. When
he calls for them, he does not have the price for the
work, and the cobbler refuses to give them up. Both
A and the cobbler have a property right in the shoes.
The right to absolute ownership is in A, that is his
property right. The temporary possession, however,
is in the cobbler, and he may hold the shoes under the
lien for repairs indefinitely and until he receives his
compensation. The lien is his property right. When
we use the term property in its lowest form we mean
by it the right of possession. In our illustration, the
cobbler's lien gives him the right of possession. When
we use the term in its highest form, we mean the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
of exclusive ownership; in our illustration, A's shoes
after he has paid the repair bill and secured the shoes
again.</p>

<p>THE RIGHTS OF OWNERSHIP.&mdash;Exclusive
ownership implies:</p>

<p>1. The right of exclusive possession for an indeterminate
time.</p>

<p>2. The right of exclusive enjoyment for an indeterminate
time.</p>

<p>3. The right of disposition.</p>

<p>4. The right of recovery if the thing be wrongfully
taken or withheld.</p>

<p>But, you say, this is not the idea one ordinarily
has of the term "property." One speaks thus of his
watch: "I own this watch. It is my property." The
answer is, property is a term with a double meaning.
In the ordinary sense "property" indicates the thing
itself, rather than the rights attached to it. Therefore
it is that we have a law of personal property, and
a law of real property.</p>

<p>PERSONAL PROPERTY AND REAL PROPERTY
DISTINGUISHED.&mdash;Real property has been
defined to be co-extensive with lands, tenements, and
hereditaments; to put it more simply, we may say that
it consists of land and anything that is permanently
affixed to the land. Personal property embraces all
objects which are capable of ownership except land.
One fundamental difference between the two is that
real property is generally considered to be immovable,
while such property as is movable is usually termed
personal property. It is important that the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
between the two forms of property be kept in
mind because different results follow where the property
is held to be one or the other. For example, on
the death of the owner of real property, it passes to
his heir or devisee, while in the case of personal property,
it goes to the personal representative, the executor
or the administrator, and through him to the legatee
or distributee. Again, in settling the estate of the
deceased person, personal property is always to be
used first to pay the decedent's debts. The modes of
transferring personal property and real property differ.
Real property is transferred by deed. Personal
property may be transferred without any writing and
even in the case of a transfer of personal property, by
a bill of sale, the requirements for recording it are
generally quite different from those relating to the
recording of deeds. Again, the transfer of real property
is governed by the law of the place where the real
property is situated, whereas the transfer of personal
property is governed by the law of the domicile of the
owner. Taxation is another subject where the distinction
is most important.</p>

<p>SALES OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.&mdash;The
most important branch of the law of personal property,
in the field of commercial law, is that relating to
the sale of personal property. We shall confine the
balance of this chapter to a consideration of that subject.
As we have a uniform Negotiable Instruments
Law, so we also have a Uniform Sales Act which has
now been adopted in many of the States. The Sales
Act defines a sale and a contract to sell as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
(1) A contract to sell goods is a contract whereby the
seller agrees to transfer the property in goods to the
buyer for a consideration called the price. (2) A sale
of goods is an agreement whereby the seller transfers
the property in goods to the buyer for a consideration
called the price. (3) A contract to sell or a sale may
be absolute or conditional. (4) There may be a contract
to sell or a sale between one part owner and
another.</p>

<p>SALES AND CONTRACTS TO SELL.&mdash;Sales
are to be distinguished from contracts to sell. A sale
is an actual transfer of property, whereas a contract
to sell is an agreement to make a sale in the future.
Sales at a shop, for instance, are made without any
contract to sell, but orders for goods at a distance,
and agreements to ship them, frequently precede the
actual sale of the goods, which is made in pursuance
of the prior contract to sell. The sale of personal
property is subject to different rules from the sale of
real estate. In the transfer of real estate, formalities
of deed and seal are necessary, which are not required
in personal property, and the subjects must be considered
separately.</p>

<p>A SALE DISTINGUISHED FROM SIMILAR
TRANSACTIONS.&mdash;At the outset, a sale must be
distinguished from several other similar transactions.
The law of sales is a branch of contract law, hence
consideration is necessary in a sale. A gift, on the
other hand, which may result in the transfer of personal
property in practically the same manner as a
sale, does not require any consideration. Hence, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
agreement to sell goods is unenforceable if not supported
by consideration. A promise to make a gift is
always unenforceable because the very idea of a gift
negatives any idea of consideration. A sale and a bailment
must also be distinguished. A bailment is the
rightful holding of an article of personal property by
one, for the accomplishment of a certain purpose, with
an obligation to return it after the completion of that
purpose. Where there is a sale, the entire property
right passes to the new buyer, and if the article is
destroyed, providing title has passed, the new buyer
must pay the purchase price if he has not already done
so, although he gets nothing for it. In a bailment,
the title does not pass. The case of the cobbler repairing
the shoes is an illustration of a bailment. If, while
the shoes are in his possession, his shop is burned,
through no fault of his, the owner of the shoes would
stand the loss. If I borrow a person's automobile, and
while using it the car is struck by lightning and totally
destroyed, the loss falls on the owner because this also
is a bailment. On the other hand, had I bought the
car and temporarily kept it in the seller's garage,
awaiting the completion of my own garage, and it is
burned while in his garage, the loss is mine. By such a
transaction, I become the owner when the sale is made,
and the former owner becomes the bailee.</p>

<p>FORMALITIES NECESSARY FOR THE
COMPLETION OF A SALE.&mdash;The Sales Act provides
in section 3, subject to a few provisions, that "a
contract to sell or a sale may be made in writing
(either with or without seal), or by word of mouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth,
or may be inferred from the conduct of the parties."
The main qualification of the right to make an oral
sale or contract to sell is found in the next section
(Section 4) which is virtually a copy of a similar provision
in the English Statute of Frauds in regard to
the sale of personal property. Section 4 reads as follows:</p>

<p>"(1) A contract to sell or a sale of any goods or
choses in action of the value of five hundred dollars or
upwards shall not be enforceable by action unless the
buyer shall accept part of the goods or choses in action
so contracted to be sold, and actually receive the same,
or give something in earnest to bind the contract, or in
part payment, or unless some note or memorandum in
writing of the contract or sale be signed by the party
to be charged or his agent in that behalf.</p>

<p>"(2) The provisions of this section apply to every
such contract or sale, notwithstanding that the goods
may be intended to be delivered at some future time
or may not at the time of such contract or sale be actually
made, procured, or provided, or fit or ready for
delivery, or some act may be requisite for the making
or completing thereof, or rendering the same fit for
delivery; but if the goods are to be manufactured by
the seller especially for the buyer and are not suitable
for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's
business, the provisions of this section shall not
apply.</p>

<p>"(3) There is an acceptance of goods within the
meaning of this section when the buyer, either before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
or after delivery of the goods, expresses by words or
conduct his assent to becoming the owner of those
specific goods."</p>

<p>THE CAPACITY OF PARTIES.&mdash;The Sales
Act provides in section 2 that "capacity to buy and sell
is regulated by the general law concerning capacity to
contract, and transfer and acquire property. Where
necessaries are sold and delivered to an infant, or to a
person who by reason of mental incapacity or drunkenness
is incompetent to contract, he must pay a reasonable
price therefor. Necessaries in this section
mean goods suitable to the condition in life of such
infant or other person, and to his actual requirements
at the time of delivery."</p>

<p>IMPORTANCE OF DISTINGUISHING
SALE AND CONTRACT TO SELL.&mdash;Why is it important
to distinguish between a contract to sell and a
sale; what difference does it make whether title has
passed or not? The primary reason that it makes a
difference is because as soon as the title has been
transferred from the seller to the buyer the seller is
entitled to the price. Prior to the transfer of title,
if the buyer refused to take the goods, the seller would
be entitled only to damages, which would be the difference
between the value of the goods which the
seller still retained and the price which was promised.
If the goods were worth as much or more than the
amount of the price promised, the seller would not be
entitled to any substantial damages. But after title
has passed the buyer must pay the full price, and the
seller may recover it if the buyer refuses to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
delivery. Another consequence flowing from the
transfer of title is that the goods are thereafter at the
risk of the buyer. If they are destroyed by accident
the buyer must nevertheless pay the price, for the
right to the price accrued before the goods were destroyed,
and when they were destroyed they were at
the buyer's risk. Bankruptcy is another circumstance
which makes it important to determine who holds title
to the goods. If the buyer becomes bankrupt, after
title to the goods has passed to him, his trustee in
bankruptcy takes the goods for his creditors, but if
he becomes bankrupt before title has passed that
would not be true. The bankruptcy of the seller would
make a similar difference.</p>

<p>WHEN TITLE IS PRESUMED TO PASS.&mdash;There
are several presumptions in the law as to when
title will be presumed to pass if there was no specific
agreement between the parties as to when it should
pass. If they simply bargain for the goods without
saying anything about the time when the buyer is to
become the owner, the first presumption is that title
passes as soon as the goods are specified and the parties
are agreed on the terms of the bargain, even
though no part of the price has been paid and though
the goods have not been delivered. It is often assumed
that delivery is essential to transfer title to
goods, but that is not so, though delivery is strong
evidence of intent to transfer title. If the parties have
made their bargain, and definitely agreed on the terms
of the bargain, title passes even though possession of
the goods still remains in the hands of the seller. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
seller, however, has a lien for the price though he has
parted with title. As long as the goods are in his
possession he may refuse to surrender until he is paid
the price, unless he agreed to sell on credit.</p>

<p>TITLE PASSES WHEN PARTIES AGREE.&mdash;It
is only a presumption that, where the terms of a
bargain are fixed and the goods are specified, title
passes at once, for if the parties agree that title shall
not pass at once it will pass when and as they agree.
Their intention in regard to the transfer of title may
not be stated in express terms, and it may be gathered
only from the acts or words of the parties. If something
remains to be done to the goods by the seller, to
put them in a deliverable condition, that indicates an
intent that title shall not pass until they are in the condition
agreed upon. If the parties provide that the
goods shall be stored at the expense of the seller, for
a time or at the risk of the seller, that indicates title is
not intended to pass, for if they are at the seller's expense
and risk, presumably they are still his goods.
On the other hand, delivery of the goods indicates an
intent to pass title, although it is possible, if the parties
so agree, that title does not pass even though the
goods are delivered. Again, payment of the price is
evidence tending to show an intent to pass title, for
buyers do not ordinarily pay the price in advance. It
is not uncommon for credit to be given by the seller,
but it is uncommon for the buyer to pay first; but even
that is not impossible, and therefore, though payment
of the price is evidence of an intent to transfer title
immediately, it is not conclusive evidence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>TRANSFER OF TITLE BY SUBSEQUENT
APPROPRIATION.&mdash;Suppose title does not pass
immediately, which may be due to the fact that the
parties so agreed, or to the fact that the goods were
not specified at the time the bargain was made. That
is a common case. A and B contract for the sale of 100
cases of shoes to be made by A. At the time the parties
make their bargain the shoes have not yet been
made, but the parties expect that they will be made
later, and appropriated to the bargain, as the legal
phrase is. Or title may not pass at the time the bargain
is made, although the goods are specified. The
parties may have expressly agreed that title should not
pass; or though the goods are specified, something
may remain to be done to them by the seller to put
them in a deliverable condition. Now, if title for any
of these reasons does not pass when the bargain is
made, it may pass by an express agreement of the
parties, made later, that the buyer shall take title and
that the seller shall give title; or frequently it may
pass by what is called an appropriation of the goods
by the seller to the buyer, without any express later
assent of the buyer, by virtue of an implied assent of
the buyer given in the original agreement that the seller
should appropriate the goods. What is meant will
be understood by one or two illustrations.</p>

<p>APPROPRIATIONS BY DELIVERY TO A
CARRIER.&mdash;Suppose A contracts to sell and ship to
the buyer 100 cases of shoes, and B contracts to receive
and pay for them. That shipment to the buyer
is an appropriation of the goods. The very 100 cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
with which the seller intends to fulfill the bargain are
indicated by the delivery of them to the carrier, and
the buyer, since he agreed in the first place that they
should be shipped, has assented to the appropriation.
Therefore, in such a case, as soon as the goods are
delivered to the carrier the presumption is that title
passes to the buyer. This is by far the commonest
case of appropriation by the seller in accordance with
authority given by the buyer in his original agreement,
and it is so common that it deserves a little further
treatment.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;This kind of appropriation
can be very well illustrated by the case of a supposed
sale of tobacco to a minor. A, a minor, lives in
an outlying suburb of Boston where the sale of
tobacco to a minor is not permitted. He buys goods
of S. S. Pierce Company in Boston and wants to buy
some cigars from them. He can buy cigars of them in
Boston and send them out to his home, but the title
must pass to him in Boston. If the title passes in the
suburb it is an illegal sale by S. S. Pierce Company,
and consequently they do not want to make it. Of
course the buyer can go and get the goods and pay for
them in Boston and send them himself to his residence.
But suppose he sends an order by mail; if S. S.
Pierce Company are willing to charge goods to him,
giving him credit, they can send the goods by express,
because on their shipment of the goods the title will
pass and the buyer will become a debtor for the price
of the goods in Boston; but they must not send the
goods by their own wagon, as their carrying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
goods themselves out to the buyer's residence leaves
them in their possession until delivery, and the delivery
does not take place until the goods are delivered
from their wagon at his house. That would not
do. Whereas if the goods are delivered to a public
carrier in Boston the carrier would be the buyer's
agent and title would pass in Boston.</p>

<p>THE SELLER MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY
AUTHORITY GIVEN HIM.&mdash;Suppose the buyer
specified that the goods are to be shipped by a given
route, and the seller shipped them by a different route.
Title would not pass then because the buyer had not
authorized the seller to appropriate them to him, the
buyer, in that way. It may be that the seller's way of
sending them was better than that originally assented
to by the buyer, but the seller, if he wishes to hold the
buyer, as owner of the goods from the time of shipment,
must get his approval of that better way. Still
more important than the method of shipment is the
character of the goods themselves. The seller cannot,
by putting any goods on the train, transfer title. He
must put on the train the very kind of goods which the
buyer agreed to receive, and that will mean not simply,
in the case supposed, that the goods must be shoes,
but they must be merchantable shoes of the character
and sizes which the buyer agreed to take. The goods
must be properly packed and all usual precautions in
regard to them taken. In so far as the original agreement
specified what was to be done, those things must
be done. In so far as the original agreement does not
specify how the goods are to be shipped, or what shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
be done in regard to them, the seller has discretion to
do anything which is customary and proper for a careful
business man.</p>

<p>SHIPMENT OF GOODS C. O. D.&mdash;There has
been considerable litigation in regard to the effect of
shipping goods C. O. D. Suppose goods were ordered
and goods of the sort ordered were shipped in accordance
with the directions in the order, but were marked
C. O. D. Those letters mean, as you know, collect on
delivery, and two possible explanations may be given
of their effect. One, that the seller retains not only
control of, but also title to, the goods until they are
delivered and the price paid. According to that view
the carrier is made the seller's agent, to hold the title
to the goods and transfer it to the buyer when he pays
for the goods. But the better view is that the carrier
merely retains a hold on the goods, a lien on behalf of
the seller, while title to the goods passes on shipment.</p>

<p>EFFECT OF THE FORM OF A BILL OF
LADING.&mdash;One cannot speak of title passing or being
retained on shipment of goods without referring to
bills of lading, for the general rules which have been
given must be qualified by this statement, that by
means of a bill of lading the title may be at will retained
or transferred (if the buyer has authorized a
transfer). The proper way to indicate a transfer of
title when goods are shipped is to have the buyer
named as consignee in the bill of lading. A bill of
lading is very much like a promissory note; the carrier
promises to deliver the goods to somebody who is
called the consignee, and who corresponds to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
payee of a note. There is this further feature in a bill
of lading: the carrier acknowledges receipt of the
goods from the consignor, that is, the shipper, and the
carrier promises to deliver them.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS.&mdash;Now, when S. S. Pierce
Company decide to ship goods to a buyer, it may consign
them to the buyer or it may consign them to
itself; that is, the same person may be consignor and
consignee. That is very common in business, in order
that the shipper may retain title to the goods until he
receives payment. He takes the bill of lading in his
own name and then, generally, attaches a draft on
the buyer of the goods, and sends the bill of lading
and the draft together through a bank. The bank
notifies the drawee of the draft, who is the man who
has agreed to buy the goods, that the bill of lading
with the draft are at the bank, and that the buyer may
have the bill of lading when he pays the draft. The
buyer pays the draft and gets the bill of lading, and
then for the first time does he become the owner of
the goods. On the other hand, if the shipper&mdash;S. S.
Pierce Company&mdash;had consigned the goods directly
to the buyer, the buyer would have become the owner
of the goods on shipment, provided the buyer had
authorized that shipment. The seller cannot, however,
by naming a buyer consignee, make the buyer
owner of any goods which he has not agreed to receive.
So much for appropriation of the goods to the
buyer by shipment. In another chapter fuller reference
will be made to bills of lading as documents of
title and as bank securities. In this connection they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
are referred to merely as indicating an intention to
transfer or retain title as between buyer and seller.</p>

<p>IMPORTANCE OF DELIVERY IN SALES
OF GOODS.&mdash;Title to chattel property, it has been
said, may pass without delivery. This is true as between
the parties, but as against creditors and third
persons delivery is necessary. Suppose A sells a horse
to B and does not deliver the horse, and A afterwards
sells the horse to C and does deliver the horse to C.
B comes around to C and says, "That is my horse. I
paid A the full price." C may say, "I bought him in
good faith. I thought it was A's horse. I have got
him and I am going to keep him." C may keep him.</p>

<p>PLACE OF DELIVERY.&mdash;Certain contractual
rights between the buyer and seller are implied from
the nature of the bargain of sale. A seller is under an
implied obligation not only to transfer title to the
buyer, but to deliver possession to him. Where must
the seller deliver possession? If the contract states
the place, the terms of the contract decide that question.
If the contract does not expressly state where
the place is to be, the place of the seller's residence is
the place where the seller is bound to deliver, unless
the goods are too heavy for easy transportation, and
in that case the place of delivery is the place where
the goods are at the time of the bargain. That may be
the seller's place of business, and it may not.</p>

<p>DELIVERY AND PAYMENT ARE CONCURRENT
CONDITIONS.&mdash;Concurrently with
the seller's duty to deliver possession, the buyer is
under a duty to pay the price, unless the contract provides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
for a period of credit. The delivery and the payment
of the price are, in the absence of contrary
agreement, concurrent conditions. The seller must
offer to deliver if he wants to get a right of action for
the price, and the buyer must tender payment if he
wants a right of action for the goods. The tender of
price and delivery must be at the place where payment
and delivery is due. It may be asked, how is the
seller to tender the goods at the place delivery is due
if that is the seller's place of business and the buyer
does not appear? The answer is, that it is in effect a
tender for the seller to have the goods in the place
where they are to be delivered, he being ready and
willing to deliver them. If the buyer does not come
there the buyer must, nevertheless, pay the seller. By
the seller's readiness to perform, at the place where
performance is due, and deliver, if the buyer with his
money is at the place where payment is due, there is
in effect a tender.</p>

<p>RIGHT OF INSPECTION.&mdash;The buyer and
seller have certain other implied rights and duties. A
right which the buyer always has, in the absence of
agreement to the contrary, is a right to inspect the
goods, to see that he is getting what he bargained for,
before he accepts title and pays the price. He may,
however, waive this right of inspection; he may agree
to pay the price without seeing what he is getting,
and in modern business this is not uncommon. One
sort of bargain frequently made contains this term:
"Cash against bill of lading." That means the buyer
is to pay the price of the goods on receiving the bill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
lading. The bill of lading will usually reach him before
the goods, and, therefore, before he has a chance
to inspect; and by the terms of his bargain he has
agreed to pay cash against the bill of lading and he
must do so. Of course, if the goods when received
turn out not to be what he bargained for, he has a
right to sue for breach of contract or recovery of the
price paid. But in the first place, when the bill of
lading comes he has to assume that the goods are
going to be right and pay for the bill of lading. Another
case where a right of inspection is waived is
where goods are sent C. O. D. You order goods to be
sent in that way and the expressman brings them.
You say you want to open the package and see if the
goods are right. You will find the expressman will
not let you. He will say, "No, you must pay for the
sealed package," and until you do so, you will have no
right to the possession of the goods. If the goods are
not all right you have redress by suing the seller, but
you must pay your money first.</p>

<p>WARRANTIES.&mdash;Another and most important
right which the buyer has is the enforcement of warranties.
Warranties of a chattel may be either express
or implied. An express warranty is a promise or an
obligation imposed by the law because of a representation
which the seller has made in regard to the
goods. The simplest form of warranty is where the
seller says, "I warrant this horse is sound," or, "I
warrant this piano will stay in tune for a year." These
warranties are promises and are subject to the same
rules as other promises. They are contracts for consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the consideration for the promise being in
each case the purchase of the goods. But we have
warranties which are not based on promises, strictly
so called, and yet are express. A tries to sell a horse.
He says the horse is perfectly sound, four years old,
broken to harness, and has trotted a mile in three
minutes. Those are in form representations rather
than promises; they are assertions of fact, and when
A makes them it is possible he does not understand
that he is binding himself for the truth of his statements;
and yet if they are made as positive statements
of fact, the seller is held to warrant the truth
of those statements.</p>

<p>REPRESENTATIONS OF FACT AND OF
OPINION.&mdash;The great distinction, between warranties
by representation and statements in regard to
property which do not amount to express warranties,
is that between statements of opinion and statements
of positive fact. If the buyer said, "I believe the horse
can trot a mile in three minutes any day," it is not a
warranty; even the statement, "The horse can trot a
mile in three minutes" would probably not be a warranty;
but the statement, "The horse has trotted a mile
in three minutes," is a direct assertion of fact, and the
element of opinion does not occur, and therefore
that would be a warranty. Statements of value do
not amount to warranties. Those are necessarily to
some extent matters of opinion. General statements
of good quality do not, ordinarily, amount to warranties.
The courts, however, are getting stiffer and
stiffer in regard to these matters. It used to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
law that a seller could represent nearly anything he
chose in regard to his goods, and not be bound, so long
as he did not expressly say, "I warrant," or make a
promise in terms in regard to them. That was called
the rule of "caveat emptor"&mdash;"let the buyer beware"&mdash;but
this rule is almost wiped out so far as representations
of fact are concerned. Now, the seller had
better beware of what he says, for he may find himself
liable as a warrantor.</p>

<p>NO WARRANTIES IMPLIED IN SALES OF
REAL ESTATE.&mdash;There are certain warranties implied,
although the buyer does not bargain for them
and although the seller makes no express representations
regarding them. In this respect sales of personal
property differ entirely from sales of real estate. In
the case of real estate you get no warranty but what
you bargain for. If you get a deed without words of
warranty, and it turns out that the seller had no title,
in the absence of fraud you have no redress; you cannot
get your money back though you have no title to
the land.</p>

<p>WARRANTY OF TITLE IMPLIED IN
SALES OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.&mdash;In the
case of personal property it is otherwise. The first
implied warranty that exists in the case of a sale of
personalty, unless the contrary is expressly agreed,
is the implied warranty of title. The seller impliedly
warrants that he has title to the property and will
transfer title to the buyer. The only exception to this
is where a sale is made by a person in a representative
capacity, as by a sheriff or an agent. In that case the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
person making the sale does not impliedly warrant
title. In the case of an agent, however, if the agent
was authorized to make the sale, the principal would
be liable as an implied warrantor of title; and if the
agent was not authorized to make the sale, the agent
would be liable as warranting his authority&mdash;not as
warranting title to the goods, but warranting that he
had a right to bind his principal. Even in the case of
a sale by an agent, therefore, the purchaser gets substantial
redress if the title turns out to be defective.
It is possible, of course, by express agreement, for a
buyer to buy and a seller to sell merely such title as
the seller may have; but there must be an express
agreement, or very special circumstances, indicating
that such was the intention of the parties, in order to
induce a court to give this construction to a bargain.</p>

<p>IMPLIED WARRANTY OF QUALITY IN
SALES BY DESCRIPTION.&mdash;Not only are there
implied warranties of title, but there are also implied
warranties in regard to the quality of goods. The fundamental
principle at the bottom of implied warranty
of quality of goods is this: if the buyer justifiably relies
on the seller's skill or judgment to select proper
goods, then the seller is liable if he does not deliver
proper goods. We may distinguish in regard to implied
warranties of quality, sales of specific goods&mdash;that
is, sales of a particular thing&mdash;and sales of goods
by description. In the case of sales by description
there is always an implied warranty that the buyer
shall have not only goods which answer that description,
but merchantable goods which answer that description.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Suppose a seller contracts to sell so many
hogsheads of Manila sugar. The law formerly was
that the seller could tender to the buyer, in fulfillment
of that contract, the worst article that he could find
which bore the name of Manila sugar. The law at
present is that the seller must furnish to the buyer
merchantable Manila sugar; that is, Manila sugar of
average and salable quality. It does not have to be
the best, but it must be ordinarily salable as merchantable
Manila sugar.</p>

<p>IMPLIED WARRANTY IN SALES OF
SPECIFIED GOODS.&mdash;Contrast with that case a
contract to sell a specific identified lot of Manila sugar
before the buyer and seller. Is the buyer bound to
take without objection that specific lot, whether or
not it turns out to be merchantable? Or suppose you
go to a shop where they sell bicycles and buy a bicycle;
you pick out a specific bicycle, and it turns out that,
owing to defects in manufacture, it is not good for
anything. It breaks down the first time you ride it.
May the seller say, "You looked at what we had in
stock and this is the machine you agreed to buy"? It
is in this class of cases that the question of justifiable
reliance by the buyer on the seller's skill and judgment
becomes important, and in determining whether
the buyer justifiably relied on the seller's skill and
judgment several things must be considered.</p>

<p>INSPECTION AS AFFECTING IMPLIED
WARRANTY.&mdash;Was the defect open to inspection
and was there opportunity to inspect the goods? If
there was, there is less reason to suppose that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
buyer was relying on the seller's skill and judgment
than if the defect was latent and not open to inspection.</p>

<p>IMPLIED WARRANTY WHERE THE
SELLER IS A MANUFACTURER.&mdash;What was
the nature of the seller's business? Was he a manufacturer
of the goods in question? The strictest rules
of implied warranty of quality are applied against
manufacturers, and this is, you will see, reasonable,
because the manufacturer ought to know about the
goods and the buyer naturally relies on the manufacturer,
as knowing about the character of the goods, to
give goods of proper quality. Therefore, unless the
buyer pretty clearly assumes the risk himself of picking
out what is satisfactory to himself, a seller who is
a manufacturer will be held to warrant the merchantable
quality of the goods which he makes and sells.</p>

<p>IMPLIED WARRANTY WHERE THE
SELLER IS A DEALER.&mdash;The next grade below a
manufacturer is a dealer in that sort of goods. He
cannot have the same knowledge as a manufacturer,
but still, a dealer in goods of a particular kind is much
more competent to judge of their quality than an ordinary
buyer and therefore a dealer also, unless there
is special reason to suppose the buyer did not rely on
his own judgment, will be held to warrant that the
goods are merchantable.</p>

<p>IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&mdash;Sometimes there is
a warranty of still greater scope than a warranty of
merchantability; that is, a warranty of fitness for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
particular purpose. A buyer agrees to buy glue of a
manufacturer. The buyer is, as the glue manufacturer
knows, a furniture manufacturer. The glue manufacturer
sells the buyer glue which is merchantable
glue, but it not good furniture glue, as furniture glue
must be of unusual tenacity. The seller is liable here
under an implied warranty. He knew that furniture
glue was wanted. He was a glue manufacturer, and
he ought to have understood that the buyer was looking
to him to furnish glue of a sort that would not
only be salable as glue but would fulfill the purpose
which the buyer had in mind when he made the purchase.</p>

<p>KNOWN, DESCRIBED AND DEFINITE
ARTICLES.&mdash;On the other hand, if the buyer orders
what is called a known, described and definite article,
he takes upon himself the burden of determining
whether the thing which he buys will fulfill his purpose
or not. For instance, a buyer in Missouri ordered
of a boiler manufacturer two boilers selected from the
catalogue of the boiler manufacturer, describing them
by number. The boilers were good boilers, under ordinary
circumstances, but the amount of mud in the
Missouri River, on the banks of which the boilers
were to be used, was so great that they could not be
successfully used there. The buyer had no redress
against the seller in that case. He had taken upon
himself to specify the particular kind of boilers he
wanted; he got them and they were merchantable
boilers. The only trouble was that they were not fit
for use in the place where the buyer was intending to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
use them. If the buyer had simply ordered boilers
for a factory on the Missouri River, the result might
well have been the other way, for that would have
put the duty on the seller to furnish something that
was suitable for that purpose.</p>

<p>RELIANCE ON THE SELLER IS THE
ESSENTIAL ELEMENT.&mdash;The great thing to remember
throughout the whole subject is that the
implied warranty of quality depends on the justifiable
reliance of the buyer on the seller's skill. If the goods
are not merchantable under circumstances where the
buyer does rely, he can recover from the seller, even
though the seller was not guilty of negligence. A
warranty is not dependent on negligence of the seller.</p>

<p>REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY.&mdash;One
of the remedies, allowed in many but
not all States, for breach of warranty, is to return the
goods and demand the purchase money back; but
that is only one remedy. Another remedy, which is
universally allowed, is to sue for whatever damage
the breach of warranty may have caused, and one or
two cases will show how serious these damages may
be. A seller sells a pair of sheep to a buyer with a
warranty, express or implied, of their soundness.
They have an infectious disease, and when put with
a large flock of the buyer's sheep they infect the whole
flock, and the damage is the loss of the whole flock.
Another actual case was based on an implied warranty
of the quality of rags sold to a paper manufacturer.
The rags came from Turkey and were infected
with smallpox. They gave smallpox to the operatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
in the buyer's mill, and the mill had to be closed down,
which caused great loss to the manufacturer. All that
loss can be recovered from the seller of the rags, even
though he was not negligent in bringing the result
about.</p>

<p>ONLY ORIGINAL BUYER CAN RECOVER
ON A WARRANTY.&mdash;Nobody, however, can recover
on a warranty except the original buyer. For
instance, the operatives who caught smallpox could
not sue the seller unless the seller was negligent. If
he had been careless or negligent in disregarding
their safety, they could sue him in an action of tort,
though they had no contractual relation with him.
And if the buyer resells the goods the purchaser from
him cannot sue on a warranty given to the original
buyer.</p>

<p>EFFECT OF ACCEPTING DEFECTIVE
GOODS.&mdash;Another matter that has caused considerable
litigation in regard to warranty and the obligation
of the seller in regard to the quality of goods, is
the effect of acceptance by the buyer of goods which
are offered to him. Suppose a certain quantity of
Manila sugar is offered to one who has agreed to buy,
and he takes from the seller that quantity of sugar,
but finds it is not of as good quality as it ought to
have been. The buyer subsequently objects, but the
seller says, "You should have objected to that at the
outset and refused to take it. Your taking it is an
assent or acceptance of it as a fulfillment of the contract,
and any right you may have had is now gone."
It is settled law that if the defect was not observable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
with reasonable care, the buyer does not lose any right
by taking the goods, provided he gave prompt notice
of the defect as soon as it was discovered. Further,
even though at the time of delivery the buyer observed
the defect or might have observed it, it is the
law of most but by no means all States, that taking
the goods does not necessarily indicate assent to receive
them as full satisfaction of the seller's obligation.
The buyer may receive the defective goods as
full satisfaction, but the mere fact of taking them does
not prove it. It is advisable, however, for the buyer
as soon as he sees the defect to protest against it. He
may in most States safely take the goods if he says in
taking them, "These goods are defective and I do
not take them in full satisfaction;" or, if he does not
discover the defect immediately on taking the goods,
he ought to give notice as soon as he does discover
that the goods are defective, and state that, though
he proposes to keep them, he does so subject to a
claim for their defective quality.</p>

<p>SELLER'S RIGHTS WHERE BUYER FAILS
TO ACCEPT GOODS.&mdash;Now the seller has some
rights, also, that should be referred to. In the first
place, if the buyer refuses to take title to the goods
when they are tendered to him, the seller has a right
to recover damages. The amount of damages will be
the difference between the value of the goods which
the seller still retains, because the buyer will not take
them, and the contract price which was promised. If
the goods are worth as much as the price promised
for them, the seller's damages will be only nominal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
for he still has the goods and may sell them to somebody
else for as good a price as was stipulated in the
original bargain.</p>

<p>SELLER MAY RECOVER PRICE WHERE
TITLE HAS PASSED.&mdash;If the title to the goods has
passed, the seller may sue for the price. This right to
the price is secured by a lien on the goods as long as
the seller retains possession of them. If the seller has
parted with possession and with title, he cannot get
the goods back except in one narrow class of cases.</p>

<p>STOPPAGE IN TRANSIT.&mdash;If the goods are
in the hands of a carrier, or other intermediary between
the seller and buyer, even though title passed
on delivery to the carrier, the seller may stop the
goods in transit if the buyer becomes insolvent before
they are actually delivered to the buyer. The right
is exercised by notifying the carrier to hold the goods
for the shipper since the buyer has become insolvent.
The right of lien and of stoppage in transit is given
the seller to enable him to secure the price, which is
the thing of interest to him in the contract.</p>

<p>LEGAL AND EQUITABLE TITLES.&mdash;A
legal title is a full right of ownership against everybody.
The legal owner can take his goods wherever
he finds them. An equitable title is a right to have the
benefit of the goods or property, and, also, it frequently
involves a right to have the legal title transferred
to the equitable owner, making him full legal
owner. The peculiar feature of an equitable title,
however, is that it is good only against the particular
person who, as the phrase goes, is subject to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
equity, and also against any person who has acquired
the property, either without giving value or with
knowledge of the equity. To put the matter conversely,
an equitable title is not good against a purchaser
for value without notice, or, in the language of
the Negotiable Instruments Law, against a holder in
due course.</p>

<p>FRAUDULENT SALES.&mdash;This principle is important
in other branches of the law besides that
governing negotiable instruments. The most common
case of equitable rights in sales arises in fraudulent
sales. Where a sale is induced by fraud of the
buyer, he gets the legal title to the goods, but the
seller has an equitable title or right to get the goods
back. Let us see how this works out. The buyer procures
goods by fraud and he sells them to A. Now,
the defrauded seller cannot get the goods back from
A if A paid value for them in good faith. If A did not
pay value in good faith, then the defrauded seller may
get the goods from him or anybody who stands in
the same position. If the defrauded seller can reach
the goods before they have left the hands of the
fraudulent person, he may replevy them or he may
seize them if that is possible. It is not worth while
to go into the various kinds of fraud that may be
practiced in the sale of goods, but there is one specific
kind that comes up very commonly which is worth
mentioning; that is, buying goods with an intention
not to pay for them. Generally, in order to create a
fraudulent sale, it is necessary that the fraudulent
person shall have made some misrepresentation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
words, but here is a case where, though it may be said
there is a misrepresentation, it is not put in words. It
may be said there is a misrepresentation, for it is fair
to say that every buyer when he buys goods not only
promises to pay but represents that his intention is
to pay for the goods, and perhaps that his financial
condition is not so hopeless as to make the expectation
utterly impossible of fulfillment. If the situation
actually was that the buyer either had a positive intention
not to pay, or was so hopelessly insolvent that
any reasonable person would know he could not pay
for the goods, the transaction is fraudulent; the seller
still retains an equity, and may reclaim the goods from
the buyer who has acquired a legal title or from any
other person except a bona fide purchaser. (A draft
of a statute to punish the making or use of false statements
to obtain property or credit, jointly prepared
by the General Counsel of the American Bankers Association
and Counsel for the National Association of
Credit Men, has been enacted in the form recommended,
or with more or less modification, in a majority
of the States. This statute provides, in substance,
that "any person who shall knowingly make
or cause to be made any false statement in writing,
with intent that it shall be relied upon, respecting the
financial condition, or means or ability to pay, of himself,
or any other person, for the purpose of procuring
in any form whatsoever, either the delivery of personal
property, payment of cash, making of a loan,
extension of credit, etc., for the benefit of either
himself or of such other person, shall be guilty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
of a felony, and punishable, etc.") This question
often arises in bankruptcy: Suppose the buyer goes
bankrupt and the goods come into the hands of the
buyer's trustee in bankruptcy. The trustee in bankruptcy
is in legal effect, in such a case, the same person
as the bankrupt; he is not a bona fide purchaser
from him, and thus the seller may reclaim the goods
from the trustee in bankruptcy just as he might from
the bankrupt. In the case supposed the seller has been
fraudulently induced to part with his title and may
reclaim it. A case may be supposed, however, where
the seller fraudulently retains his title, and here the
buyer's creditors may seize the goods as if the title
were in the buyer. Thus it is a fraud to make a conditional
sale of goods to a person who intends, and
who is understood to intend, to sell the goods again.
The reason why it is a fraud is because it is inconsistent
on the part of the wholesaler to say, "I retain
title to the goods until paid for, yet I give them to
you, knowing that you are going to put them in your
stock of trade."</p>

<p>DESTRUCTION OF GOODS SOLD.&mdash;The
question sometimes arises as to the effect of the destruction
of the goods sold or contracted to be sold.
The Sales Act in Sections 7 and 8 governs this:</p>

<p>Section 7. (1) Where the parties purport to sell
specific goods, and the goods without the knowledge
of the seller have wholly perished at the time when the
agreement is made, the agreement is void.</p>

<p>(2) Where the parties purport to sell specific
goods, and the goods without the knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
seller have perished in part or have wholly or in a
material part so deteriorated in quality as to be substantially
changed in character, the buyer may at his
option treat the sale:</p>

<p>(a) As avoided, or</p>

<p>(b) As transferring the property in all of the
existing goods or in so much thereof as have not deteriorated,
and as binding the buyer to pay the full
agreed price if the sale was indivisible, or to pay the
agreed price for the goods in which the property
passes if the sale was divisible.</p>

<p>Sec. 8 (1) Where there is a contract to sell specific
goods, and subsequently, but before the risk passes
to the buyer, without any fault on the part of the
seller or the buyer, the goods wholly perish, the contract
is thereby avoided.</p>

<p>(2) Where there is a contract to sell specific
goods, and subsequently, but before the risk passes
to the buyer, without any fault of the seller or the
buyer, part of the goods perish or the whole or a material
part of the goods so deteriorate in quality as to
be substantially changed in character, the buyer may,
at his option treat the contract:</p>

<p>(a) As avoided, or</p>

<p>(b) As binding the seller to transfer the property
in all of the existing goods or in so much thereof
as have not deteriorated, and as binding the buyer to
pay the full agreed price if the contract was indivisible,
or to pay the agreed price for so much of the
goods as the seller, by the buyer's option, is bound to
transfer if the contract is divisible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>CONDITIONAL SALES.&mdash;Certain transactions
in which personal property is held as security,
which are somewhat analogous to mortgages and
which are very common, may now be referred to.
They may be classed thus: Conditional sales, consignments,
leases and chattel mortgages. A conditional
sale, as that term is commonly used, is a transfer of
the possession of personal property under an agreement
to sell, the seller expressly retaining the title.
Here we have possession and title divided. If it were
not for the express agreement that title should remain
in the seller, the delivery of the goods to the buyer,
with his agreement to pay for them, would indicate a
transfer of title to the buyer. The purpose of the
seller in making a conditional sale is to retain security
for the price which the buyer cannot pay all at once.
Conditional sales are most common in regard to furniture
and machinery of various kinds. Creditors of
the buyer naturally suppose that the goods in his possession
are his, and it is to avoid deception, or possible
deception, that most States require that the conditional
sale be recorded, so that creditors and everybody
else may have notice that, although the buyer
seems to be owner of this property, he is not so in
reality. But, in Massachusetts, record is not required,
and conditional sales, other than those of household
furniture, need not even be in writing. The seller is
secured by this sort of bargain in several ways. If
the buyer does not pay the price when it is due, the
seller may take the goods back. They are his goods
and therefore he may reclaim them. Or the seller may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
conclude that it is better to sue for the price, and may
decide to let the buyer keep the goods and himself
collect a judgment for the price by levying on any
property the buyer may have, including that which
was conditionally bought. Even though the buyer
has paid a large part of the price of the goods, the
seller may, nevertheless, reclaim the goods. The
seller's course will be dictated largely by how much
of the price has been paid. If a large part has been
paid, the seller will very likely prefer to reclaim the
goods unless they are household furniture. Why, it
may be asked, does a buyer enter into a conditional
sale, which is rather a poor bargain as far as he is
concerned? The reason, of course, is that he cannot
pay cash and he wants the use of the goods at once,
and the conditional sale enables him to get them. By
statute, in some jurisdictions, the conditional buyer is
protected after he has paid a considerable portion of
the price; either by extending the time within which
he may pay the balance due, or by requiring a sale of
the goods and the return to the buyer of any surplus.</p>

<p>CONSIGNMENT.&mdash;How does a consignment
differ from a conditional sale? When goods are sent
or consigned it means that the person to whom they
are sent is agent for the person who sends them.
The consignment is like the conditional sale in this
respect, that the person who has possession of the
goods has not the title. The consignment differs
vitally from a conditional sale in this respect, however,
that the consignee is not a debtor for the price.
If the consignee sells the goods, then he, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
must turn over the price to the consignor less such
commission as he takes, or if the transaction was not
on commission, then the consignee must pay to the
consignor the price it was bargained the consignor
should receive. But until the goods are resold they
remain the consignor's and at his risk. If goods conditionally
sold are destroyed, the conditional buyer
must, nevertheless, pay for them. They are at his risk
and he is an absolute debtor for the price; but the
consignee merely holds the goods as agent until a
purchase takes place.</p>

<p>LEASES OF CHATTELS.&mdash;Sometimes goods
are leased. Here, again, we have the same point of
similarity, that the person who has possession of the
goods is not the owner. The lessee, like a consignee,
is not a debtor for the price; he is a debtor for rent,
but he is not a debtor for the price of the goods. Often
leases contain an option to purchase, and a lease with
an option to purchase is used by piano dealers and
others as an alternative mode of dealing with customers
unable to pay cash, instead of a conditional sale;
but it is not the same thing, for if a piano were destroyed
without fault of either party after it had been
leased with an option to purchase, the loss would be
on the seller. If the option to pay had been exercised,
of course, the loss would be on the buyer.</p>

<p>CHATTEL MORTGAGES.&mdash;The goods are
here owned originally by the mortgagor, and they
ordinarily remain in his possession after he has transferred
them by the mortgage. The fundamental principles
governing chattel mortgages are the same as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
those which govern mortgages of real estate. Chattel
mortgages must be in writing and recorded, or the
mortgaged property must be delivered to the mortgagee;
otherwise they are invalid against the creditors
or trustee in bankruptcy of the mortgagor; that
is, one may mortgage his chattels, either by delivering
them to the mortgagee or by making a writing and
having that recorded. Even without record or delivery
it is good between the parties, but it is not
good in case of bankruptcy against the trustee in
bankruptcy of the mortgagor, nor is it good against
attaching creditors if there is no bankruptcy.</p>

<p>MORTGAGES OF FUTURE GOODS.&mdash;An
agreement is sometimes made to make a mortgage of
goods which do not at the time exist, or are not at
the time defined. This is especially common in regard
to a stock of goods. A wants to borrow money on his
stock of goods in his shop. His stock may be worth
$25,000 and A has not capital enough to get along
without mortgaging it. Of course, he can mortgage
the existing stock of goods without difficulty, but the
trouble is he wants to keep on doing business, and sell
in regular course of business the mortgaged stock of
goods. That, too, would be easy enough if the mortgagee
were willing to agree to it, but the mortgagee
is not willing to agree unless equal security is substituted
for any goods that are sold. What they would
like to provide is that the mortgagor shall have power
to sell the existing goods if he chooses in the ordinary
course of business, provided he always keeps a stock
of goods on hand equal to that on hand at the time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
mortgage was made, the idea being that as one thing
is released from the lien of the mortgage other things,
of at least equal value, shall replace it. It is not an
unreasonable transaction, from a business standpoint,
but the law generally does not allow it validity except
to this extent. It is valid as between the parties so
far as to give the mortgagee a power at any time to
take possession, and when he does take possession the
mortgage is valid as to the goods of which he takes
possession against creditors or anybody else. The
mortgagee may thus take possession right up to the
time of the mortgagor's bankruptcy, or at any time
prior to actual seizure of the stock of goods on an
attachment. This gives the mortgagee some security
if the mortgagor will be good enough to give the
mortgagee a hint when it is wise for the mortgagee to
take possession, because, as the mortgagee can take
possession just before bankruptcy or just before an
attachment, the mortgagee will be protected. But, of
course, there is a chance that the mortgagee may not
get the goods, and therefore this form of security, in
most States, is not now advised, although it has been
much attempted in the past. In some States, however,
such a mortgage gives a right against goods afterwards
acquired, which is superior to that of attaching
creditors or of a trustee in bankruptcy, even though
the mortgagee does not take possession.</p>

<p>GIFTS.&mdash;A gift is the immediate voluntary
transfer of personal property. To make a valid gift,
therefore, it must be voluntary, gratuitous, and absolute.
As has been explained, a gift is distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
from a sale or a contract to sell by the fact that it is
gratuitous. Gifts are usually divided into two classes:
gifts "inter vivos" and gifts "causa mortis." There
is no distinction between these two kinds of gifts, so
far as the necessity of the intent to deliver title and
delivery of the property are concerned, but the distinction
lies in the fact that in gifts "causa mortis,"
the change in title is defeasible upon certain conditions.
The ordinary gift "inter vivos," "between living
people" is irrevocable when completed. The gift
"causa mortis," that is, one made by a person in immediate
apprehension of death, is always subject to
the condition that if the person recovers, the title to
the property, which he has given away, reverts to
him. For A, who is in his last illness, to say to B,
who is sitting near his bedside, "I wish you to have
my gold watch when I am gone, but my brother is
wearing it now in Europe" would not be a gift "causa
mortis." There is no delivery. It would not pass
title, upon his death, to his friend because in order to
dispose of property after one is dead, a will is necessary.
Even between the parties gifts are invalid unless
accompanied by delivery, or made by deed under
seal. The transaction without delivery or deed is,
in effect, a promise to give, and there being no consideration
the promisor may subsequently refuse to keep
his promise. If a savings-bank book, a bond, a stock
certificate, a life-insurance policy, a note or check of
a third person (but not one made by the giver), or
any chattel property is delivered to the donee, the
gift is binding and irrevocable; but otherwise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
donee gets absolutely nothing and the donor's executor
is entitled to the property attempted to be disposed
of by gift, and must treat it as part of the assets
of the estate.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;A recent case in New Jersey
shows clearly the effects of the application of the
rules just described. In Bailey v. Orange Memorial
Hospital, 102 Atl. 7, the facts were that the testatrix
died about June 10, 1893, leaving a will, which had
been duly probated, and under which the complainants
had qualified as executors. Among the papers,
which the executors found in the testatrix's safe deposit
box after her death, was a certificate made in her
name for fifty shares of the capital stock of the United
N. J. Railroad and Canal Co., bearing the following
indorsement, "For value received I hereby assign and
transfer unto the Orange Memorial Hospital fifty
shares of the capital stock represented by the within
certificate and do hereby irrevocably constitute and
appoint ................ attorney to transfer the said
stock on the books of the within named corporation
with full power of substitution in the premises.</p>

<p>
Mary Campfield.<br />
<br />
"Dated Oct. 28, 1911.<br />
<br />
"Witnessed by James C. MacDonald."<br />
</p>

<p>In the same envelope containing this certificate the
executors also found the following letter in the handwriting
of Mrs. Campfield: "To my executors: The
accompanying certificate of fifty shares of the United,
etc. Co. is my gift to the Orange Memorial Hospital
for a bed to be called the 'Mahlon Campfield Bed.' The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
stock has been retained since its date of transfer because
I desire to be benefited by the dividends thereon
as long as I live.</p>

<p>
Mary Campfield.<br />
<br />
"Dated Oct. 28, 1911."<br />
</p>

<p>In this box Mrs. Campfield kept her bonds and
mortgages, stock certificates, and other valuable
papers relating to her own property and to the estate
of her husband, of which she was executrix. There
were two sets of keys to the box, one of which was in
Mrs. Campfield's possession, and the other in the
possession of one of her executors, who assisted her
for some time in the management of her affairs.
Shortly before the indorsement on the certificate was
made, and the letter written, Mrs. Campfield requested
Mr. Everett, the executor, to take the stock
certificate from her box and deliver it to her attorney,
stating that she would let her attorney know in a few
days what to do about it. A few days later the attorney
handed Mr. Everett an envelope containing the
stock certificate, and told him there was a letter with
it. Mr. Everett saw the certificate but did not see
the letter, and he placed the envelope containing the
certificate in the safe deposit box. The attorney had
sealed the envelope after showing him the certificate.
After Mr. Everett had told Mrs. Campfield what had
been done, she said, "Well, that is for the hospital
and that settles it," and she added: "It is in an envelope,
as you probably saw, and addressed to my
executors, and they will find a letter inside telling
them what to do with it." After this, Mrs. Campfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
continued to receive the dividends paid on these
shares, and there is some evidence to indicate that she
had access to the safe deposit box and examined its
contents during the winter preceding her death. The
court, in its opinion, said: "I do not think there can
be any doubt of Mrs. Campfield's donative intention
regarding these shares of stock, and it is equally
clear that she never consummated that intention to
make the gift, by the actual delivery of the stock to
the hospital, or to any one as trustee for it; and it
also appears that she intended the gift should be
effective only after her death. She expressly retained
the ownership and dominion over the stock for the
purpose, at least, of collecting and enjoying the dividends
paid thereon. * * * The gift of the stock not
having been completed by delivery, or by the relinquishment
of control over the certificate representing
it, the stock must be declared to be an asset of the
estate."</p>

Real Property</h2>


<p>DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LAW
GOVERNING SALES OF REAL AND
PERSONAL PROPERTY.&mdash;The main distinction
between the law governing real and personal
property is the increased formality necessary in transactions
governing real estate. Contracts for the sale
of real estate must be in writing and actual conveyances
of an interest in land must not only be in writing,
but, except where seals have been abolished by
statute, must be executed under seal. In order to
make the transaction valid against third persons, record
in the Registry of Deeds in the county where the
land is situated is also requisite. Unless a contract
for the sale of real estate is recorded, a subsequent
conveyance to a purchaser, for value and without
notice, will destroy the right of the buyer under the
first contract to get the land, though he will still have
an action for damages against the seller. So, in many
jurisdictions, creditors of the man contracting to sell
may by attaching the land as the seller's property
satisfy their claims from it to the detriment of the
buyer's right. Therefore, an actual conveyance of
real estate must be recorded in order to protect the
grantee. As a pre-requisite for record it is generally
required that contracts and deeds of real estate shall
be acknowledged before a notary public or other
official authorized by law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>DUTIES OF BUYER AND SELLER UNDER
CONTRACT TO CONVEY REAL ESTATE.&mdash;The
primary duty of the seller in a contract to convey
real estate is to transfer a good title. It is important
for the buyer to determine before the time for
performance whether the seller's title is good in order
to determine whether he himself will accept the deed
and pay the price. Accordingly, the buyer has the title
examined by search in the Registry of Deeds. If the
search discloses that the seller's title is defective the
buyer does not on that account necessarily have a
right to rescind the contract. The defect of title may
be removed before the time of performance, and if the
nature of the defect is such that this is possible, the
buyer can only give notice of the defect and request
its removal. If the title of the seller is so defective
that it cannot be cured, or if the seller manifests by
his conduct an intent to repudiate the contract, as by
selling the land to another, the buyer need not wait
for the time for performance, but may at once give
notice that he rescinds the contract. Unless the
seller has expressly contracted to convey by warranty
deed, his obligation is generally satisfied by a quit
claim deed. It is well, therefore, for a purchaser,
when he contracts to purchase a piece of real property,
to insert in the contract a clause to the effect that the
seller agrees to convey by a sufficient warranty deed.
The seller is also bound not to commit waste on
the premises between the time of the contract and
the time of performance. The rule in regard to
accidental injury is stated hereafter, but as to intentional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
or negligent injury of the premises, the
law is clear that such an injury is a breach of duty by
the seller. The buyer's duty is to pay the price according
to the terms of the contract. The obligations
of the seller to convey, and of the buyer to buy, are
concurrent, unless the contract expressly provides the
contrary; that is, the buyer in order to acquire a right
against the seller must tender payment, as he demands
a deed; and the seller in order to acquire a
right against the buyer must tender a proper deed
when demanding payment. The obligation of either
party to tender may, however, be excused by circumstances
showing that tender would be useless. Thus,
if the buyer is insolvent, the seller need not tender a
deed, and if the buyer has repudiated the contract or
committed waste to a material extent, or conveyed
the premises to a third person, the buyer need not
tender payment, in order to acquire a right of action.
But if there is any doubt at all, the purchaser or the
seller, as the case may be, should make a tender, so as
to preserve his legal rights.</p>

<p>DOWER AND CURTESY.&mdash;By the common
law a wife on her marriage acquired a right in her
husband's land, which, though not vesting until his
death, encumbered the title immediately. On his
death she became entitled to a life estate in a one-third
interest of all the lands of which he had been
possessed since the date of their marriage. Accordingly,
where the common law rule of dower still prevails,
a husband cannot give an unencumbered title
to real estate unless his wife joins in the conveyance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Similarly a husband was entitled at common law to a
life interest in the lands of his deceased wife if they
had had a child born alive. This was called the estate
by curtesy. Its extent, it will be observed, is not the
same as that of dower. The husband's life interest
extended to all the lands of the wife, but on the other
hand, it did not arise at all unless there was a child
born alive; whereas the wife's dower right arose immediately
on marriage. The rules of dower and
curtesy have been changed by statute to a greater or
less extent in most States, but it is still almost universally
important that a wife should join in her husband's
conveyance of real estate, and that a husband
should join in a wife's conveyance of her real estate.</p>

<p>DEFAULT IN PERFORMANCE.&mdash;The law
regards more leniently a default in time in carrying
out contracts for the sale of real estate than it does a
similar default in the sale of personal property. In
sales of personal property, especially if it is of a character
which rapidly fluctuates in value, time is said
to be "of the essence;" that is, the failure of either
party to perform at or about the agreed day is fatal
to his rights to enforce the contract; but in the case of
real estate it is generally held that time is not of the
essence of the contract unless it is either expressly so
provided in the contract, or the circumstances of the
case are such as to show that time was a matter of
vital importance.</p>

<p>DESTRUCTION OF PREMISES.&mdash;Where
personal property, which the owner has contracted to
sell, is destroyed, the loss is the seller's provided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
title is still in him, and the buyer has committed no
default; but in most jurisdictions, if real estate is
similarly destroyed, the buyer must nevertheless pay
the price. In the absence of special provisions in a
contract of sale, if a house on the premises sold has
burned between the time of the contract and the time
for its performance, without fault of the seller, the
seller can compel the buyer to accept a deed of the
land without the house and pay the full price. This
rule has been much criticized, and it is not universally
in force; for example, it is not the law of Massachusetts.
In some other States the loss will not fall upon
the buyer unless possession of the premises has been
delivered to him under the contract, but in New York,
and probably a majority of the States, even though
the seller still has possession, as well as title, the risk
of accidental loss rests upon the buyer. Where risk
of destruction of the premises is thrown on the buyer,
immediately after he has made a contract to purchase,
it is of obvious importance that he should immediately
insure the premises. The insurance of the seller, unless
transferred to the buyer at that time with the
company's assent, will not protect the buyer. Insurance
is a contract of personal indemnity, and the seller's
insurance only protects the seller's interest. The
result is that if the premises are destroyed, the insurance
company will not be obliged to pay the seller his
insurance, since the seller, under the contract of sale,
can recover from the buyer; and even if the insurance
were paid to the seller, the buyer could not claim the
benefit of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.&mdash;In addition to
the ordinary remedy for a breach of contract, namely
an action at law for damages, another remedy, that of
specific performance, is permitted in the case of contracts
for the sale of land; that is, the court will actually
compel one who has contracted to sell land to
make a conveyance thereof on receiving the agreed
price, and will similarly compel one who has contracted
to buy to pay the agreed price on receiving a
deed of the premises. Specific performance of such
contracts is granted on the theory that money damages
are an inadequate remedy, and that the nature of
the situation is such that it is possible to compel the
actual performance of the contract. In contracts for
the sale of personal property, damages are generally
considered adequate, but contracts for the sale of a
painting or a race-horse would be specifically enforced.
Sometimes the seller is unable fully to perform his
agreed contract. He may not be able to give a title
free from encumbrances, or he may have committed
waste on the premises. In such a case, though the
buyer need not carry out the contract unless he
wishes, he can if he chooses get a conveyance decreed
to him and an allowance deducted from the price
commensurate to the injury caused by the encumbrance
or waste. Specific performance will be granted
not only against the seller, but if the seller in violation
of his contract has conveyed the land to a third
person who had notice of the contract or who did not
give value in exchange for the land, the court will
compel the grantee of the premises to convey them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the person who had the original contract to buy. If,
however, one who has agreed to sell the premises
actually sells and conveys them to another who is a
purchaser for value without notice of the prior contract,
such a purchaser gets an indefeasible title, and
the person having the prior contract to buy must resort,
for his only relief, to an action for damages
against the seller. For this reason it is important to
record a contract to buy or sell. This record operates
as notice to all the world, and no purchaser subsequent
to the record will have the rights of a purchaser
for value without notice.</p>

<p>VENDOR'S LIEN.&mdash;In some States a seller of
land who has not been paid the price is entitled to
what is called a vendor's lien on the land. This enables
him to compel a sale of the property to satisfy
his claim for the purchase money unless the land has
been conveyed, before proceedings are brought to enforce
the lien, to a purchaser for value without notice
that the original vendor is still unpaid. In many
States, however, the seller has no vendor's lien and
must take a mortgage back for any unpaid portion of
the purchase price if he desires security for its payment.</p>

<p>DEFINITION OF MORTGAGE.&mdash;A mortgage
is a transfer of property to a creditor to secure a
debt. Unless there is a debt there can be no mortgage,
and the original idea of a mortgage, still preserved in
the forms of conveyance in many States, is that the
mortgagor or debtor transfers the title to the mortgagee
or creditor. In popular understanding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
mortgagor owns the mortgaged premises but the
mortgagee will take or sell them if the debt is in default.
The theory of the common law, however, was
that the mortgagee became the owner of the premises
as soon as the mortgage was made, but that the
mortgagor was entitled to re-acquire the ownership
by payment of the debt at maturity. Indeed, early
mortgages were often made by two separate instruments:
(1) an absolute deed of conveyance to the
mortgagee, and (2) an instrument called a defeasance
which provided that on payment of the amount of the
debt, on a given day, the property should revest in the
mortgagor.</p>

<p>MODERN AMERICAN MORTGAGES.&mdash;At
the present day in many jurisdictions a mortgage still
remains, both in the form of the instrument and in the
legal conception of the rights of the parties fundamentally,
the same as under the early doctrines just
outlined. In other jurisdictions, of which New York
may be taken as a typical State, the theory is no
longer that the mortgagee has title to the property,
but that he has only a lien on it, which he may enforce
if the debt is not paid. The difference in actual results
under the two theories, however, is less than
might be supposed. Where the mortgagee is still regarded
as having the title, his power to make use of
that title is limited so that he can only make use of it
for the purpose of securing payment of what is due
him. On the other hand where the mortgagee is regarded
as having only a lien, the lien is a legal right
against the real estate which enables the creditor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
enforce his claim against it in practically the same
way which he would do were he the owner of the real
estate.</p>

<p>COVENANTS AND STIPULATIONS.&mdash;A
mortgage of real estate ordinarily contains the same
covenants of warranty as a warranty deed of real
estate. Where a mortgage still has its common law
effect of transferring title to the mortgagee, it is essential
that the mortgage should contain a provision
that until default the mortgagor shall be entitled to
the possession of the premises. Covenants in regard
to the payment of taxes by the mortgagor and the
keeping of the premises insured for a certain amount,
are usual and important provisions. There is also
commonly contained in a mortgage a power of sale;
that is an authority or agency given to the mortgagee
to sell the premises free of the mortgagor's right of
redemption in case default of payment is made, or in
case such default continues for a certain specified
time. In all States printed forms of mortgages are
ordinarily used. These forms are prepared with care
to suit the requirements of local law; and if you are
sure that the printed form is prepared and sold for
use in the State where the mortgaged land is situated,
you may feel satisfied that the terms of the instrument
are suitable to protect the rights of both parties.</p>

<p>EXECUTION AND RECORD OF MORTGAGE.&mdash;A
mortgage of real estate must everywhere
be executed with the same formality that is necessary
for an ordinary deed of conveyance. Different forms
are in use in different States, and it is always desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
to use the form of mortgage customary in the State
where the land lies. It is important to ascertain
whether a seal is necessary in that State, and the instrument
must ordinarily be acknowledged before a
notary public having a seal, or before a commissioner
of deeds for the State in which the land lies. There
is in every State a recording act by virtue of which
unrecorded mortgages are made invalid against subsequent
purchasers and sometimes against attaching
creditors. Though an unrecorded mortgage is, as between
the parties, as effective as if recorded, it is of
vital importance promptly to record every mortgage
in the Registry of Deeds in the county where the land
lies.</p>

<p>SPECIAL CASES.&mdash;Where a mortgage is executed
by an agent or by a corporation, it is essential
that the agent or corporate officer have authority to
act. In the case of a corporation it is necessary both
that the corporation have power to make the mortgage
in question and also that the particular officer or
officers who attempt to exercise the power are authorized
so to do. The principles here involved, however,
are not different from those generally governing the
acts of agents and corporations. The same may be
said in regard to mortgages by husband or wife, by a
partnership, or by trustees. In the case of mortgages
executed by any such person it is necessary to take
special precautions. A mortgage by husband or wife
should generally be also executed by the other. A
mortgage by a partnership should be executed in the
same form in which the title is held by the partnership,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and if the title is held by less than all the partners,
it is desirable that the other partners should
express their assent to the transaction either in the
mortgage itself, or in a separate instrument executed
with the same formality.</p>

<p>INTEREST IN PROPERTY.&mdash;Any kind of interest
in real estate may be mortgaged and mortgages
of property, not yet acquired by the mortgagor, have
generally been held to attach to the property when
acquired by the mortgagor, and then to give the mortgagee
as full a right as if the mortgagor had owned
the premises at the time he purported to mortgage
them.</p>

<p>OTHER PARTICULARS.&mdash;The description of
land in a mortgage should have the same exactness as
is necessary in a deed. Unlike deeds, mortgages ordinarily
state their consideration and must of course
state the indebtedness which they are given to secure.
A mortgage may be given to secure a past debt if the
mortgagor, when he makes the mortgage, is solvent.
If he is then insolvent, to give such a mortgage would
be a preference, which is an act of bankruptcy, and
subject the mortgagor to possible bankruptcy proceedings.
If the mortgagee in such a case had reasonable
cause to believe that the mortgagor was insolvent,
the mortgage could also be set aside by a trustee in
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>EQUITY OF REDEMPTION.&mdash;By the terms
of the mortgage the mortgagor's right is ordinarily
made dependent on payment of the debt on a fixed day,
or of installments on fixed days. A day thus fixed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
mortgage is sometimes called the "law day." According
to the terms of the instrument the only way in
which the mortgagor can be revested with title to the
property is by complying with the express terms of
the mortgage and paying the debt on the law day. The
result of this provision, if enforced, would be that if
the debt is not paid exactly when it is due, the mortgagee
remains the absolute owner of the mortgaged
premises. Courts of equity, however, long ago limited
the mortgagee's right, holding that the real object
of the transaction is to secure a debt, and that if the
mortgagee obtains his debt and interest he ought to
be satisfied. Accordingly if the mortgagor was in default
in the payment of the debt, he was allowed to
redeem the property by payment of the debt and interest
until the time of tender. If the mortgagee refused
to accept his debt and interest, the mortgagor
could bring a suit in equity to redeem the property
and the court would order the reconveyance to him
of the property on payment of the debt. Because of
this right on the part of the mortgagor, his interest
in the property came to be called an equity of redemption,
and it is often so called at the present day. The
position taken by courts of equity, permitting redemption,
might work a hardship on the mortgagee
because he could never feel sure of his title to the
property, however long the debt might remain unpaid.
This difficulty was met by allowing the mortgagee
to bring a suit to foreclose the debtor's right of
redemption. We speak of foreclosing a mortgage,
but, strictly, it is the debtor's right to redeem which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
foreclosed. When such a suit of foreclosure was
brought equity would fix a time within which the
debtor might redeem the premises by paying the debt
and interest, and then the decree provided that if the
debtor failed to pay within the named period, his right
of redemption should be forever foreclosed. At the
present time there are in practically all jurisdictions
statutory rules, in regard to the foreclosure of mortgages,
which we shall presently describe, but it is important
to remember the fundamental nature of the
mortgage transaction, and the original remedies of redemption
and foreclosure.</p>

<p>A RECONVEYANCE IS NOT NECESSARY
ON PAYMENT OF THE MORTGAGE.&mdash;If a
mortgage is regarded as a mere lien to secure a debt,
it is obvious that a payment of the debt discharges the
lien, and the title already vested in the mortgagor becomes
free from any incumbrance. On the theory of
the common law, though the title passed to the mortgagee,
it was subject to a condition subsequent which
would revest the title in the mortgagor if payment of
the debt was made at maturity. By mere operation
of law, therefore, payment of the mortgage when due
revested title in the mortgagor without reconveyance.
After a default, however, a subsequent payment is not
strictly a performance of the condition upon which
the mortgaged deed provided that title should revest.
Accordingly a reconveyance was necessary in such a
case at common law, but at the present day it is generally
not requisite even in case of payment after
default.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>THE MORTGAGOR IS LIABLE AS A
DEBTOR.&mdash;The mortgagor is bound as a debtor ordinarily
by a bond or promissory note in which he expressly
agrees to pay the amount of his debt. It is
perfectly possible that the debt secured by the mortgage
should not be represented by such an instrument,
but should rest merely in oral agreement or should
be contained in a covenant in the mortgage deed itself,
but it is usual and desirable to have a separate obligation.
The fact that the debtor has given the mortgage
does not in any way limit the rights of the mortgagee
as an ordinary creditor. He may sue on the mortgage
debt when it is due, in the same manner as if there
were no mortgage. It is his option whether he will
foreclose the mortgage, as a means of collecting his
claim, or whether he will get judgment on the debt,
and seek to collect that judgment in the same way
that an ordinary judgment creditor would. This rule
is changed by statute in California, and one or two
other States, where by statute the mortgagee is required
to realize from the mortgaged property what
he can before seeking a personal judgment against
the mortgagor. In many jurisdictions the creditor
may, in a single proceeding, obtain foreclosure of the
mortgagor's rights by sale of the property, and a personal
judgment against the mortgagor for any deficiency
which the proceeds of the property may leave.
This is called a deficiency judgment.</p>

<p>RIGHTS OF MORTGAGOR AND MORTGAGEE
IN MORTGAGED LAND.&mdash;Even though
the mortgagor is regarded by the law as having no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
longer the legal title to the premises, but only an
equity of redemption, his interest is regarded as real
estate and descends on his death according to the
laws governing real estate. The mortgagee's interest,
on the other hand, is regarded as personal property
since the debt which the mortgagee is intended
to secure is personal property, and even a legal title
to the real estate held by the mortgagee is held merely
for security, and is an incident to the debt. So the
mortgagor's interest in mortgaged property is subject
to be seized on execution by his creditors while
the mortgagee's interest can not be so seized. The
mortgagee's creditors must reach his interest by
means appropriate to realize upon the debt, not upon
the land. The mortgagor's interest being regarded
as real estate will give rise to the same estates of
dower in favor of the wife of the deceased mortgagor
or curtesy in favor of the husband of a deceased mortgagor,
as are allowed by the law in the case of real
estate generally. The mortgagor may, while in possession,
deal with the property in any way in which an
owner may, except that he will not be permitted to
imperil the mortgagee's security by any kind of waste.
The mortgagor may, subject to the mortgage, lease,
sell or devise it. He may collect the rents and profits
and use them as his so long as he is in possession.
Where, however, the mortgagee is regarded as having
the legal title to the premises, he may eject the
mortgagor at any time from possession, even though
the mortgage is not due, unless prohibited by statute
or by the express terms of the mortgage deed. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
fact he usually is so prohibited. Even when not so
prohibited, it is not always well for a mortgagee to
take possession because, if he does so, he is bound to
account not only for all profits actually received from
the premises, but also for all that might have been
received. He becomes liable for any waste of the
premises or any failure to deal with them in a reasonably
prudent manner.</p>

<p>SALE BY MORTGAGEE OR MORTGAGOR
OF REAL ESTATE.&mdash;Either the mortgagee or the
mortgagor may assign his interest. The mortgagee
in assigning his interest is in legal contemplation doing
two things: (1) assigning the debt; (2) assigning
the title or lien which he holds on the mortgagor's
real estate as security for the debt. As to the assignment
of the debt, the matter is governed by the same
principles as govern the assignment of choses in action
generally. That is, if the mortgaged debt is
represented by a negotiable instrument, the instrument
may be negotiated to the purchaser in the ordinary
way, and with the ordinary effects of such instruments.
If the mortgaged debt is not represented
by a negotiable instrument, the assignment of the
debt is an assignment of a chose in action. Where
the common law view of mortgage still prevails, that
the mortgagee has the legal title, he can only transfer
it to an assignee by a deed executed with the same
formalities necessary for the transfers of real estate.
As, however, the law recognizes that it is the debt
which is the essential feature of the relation between
mortgagor and mortgagee, and that the mortgaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
estate is held merely as security for a debt, a valid
assignment of the debt is held to make the assignee
equitably entitled to the mortgaged property as security.
And, in effect, one who obtains the mortgage
debt will secure the benefit of the mortgaged property
even though the local law regards a mortgagee as
having the legal title. Where the mortgagee is regarded
as having merely a lien, the assignment of the
debt involves a transfer of the lien.</p>

<p>INCIDENTS TO MORTGAGE.&mdash;If the mortgagor
wishes to convey his interest, he transfers the
estate by deed exactly as if it were unmortgaged, except
that the conveyance is stated to be subject to a
specified mortgage, and it is sometimes added "which
the grantee assumes and agrees to pay." It is desirable
for the seller that the grantee shall assume and
agree to pay the mortgage while it is desirable for the
buyer that he shall buy the premises merely subject to
the mortgage without assuming it. The difference
between the two transactions is this: In either event
the grantee receives the premises burdened by a mortgage,
the amount of which will be deducted from the
consideration paid as the agreed value of the premises.
In either event, if the debt is unpaid, the mortgagee
will foreclose and the grantee will lose the premises.
In order to save the premises, the grantee will have
to pay the mortgage.</p>

<p>ASSUMPTION OF MORTGAGE.&mdash;The distinction
is only seriously important when the mortgaged
premises are worth less than the amount of the
mortgage. In that event the mortgagee will be entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
to a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor. The
mortgagor was the original debtor and cannot escape
from his obligation to the mortgagee without the latter's
assent. If the mortgagor is forced to pay, he
cannot recover the amount from his grantee unless the
latter assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage. If,
however, the grantee did make such assumption, he
will ultimately have to pay the deficiency. If the mortgagee,
without foreclosing the property, should sue
the mortgagor directly on the debt, the latter would
be compelled to pay. Even if the sale to the mortgagor's
grantee had been made merely subject to the
mortgage, the mortgagor on paying the debt would
be subrogated to the mortgage and would himself be
enabled to foreclose the property. But if the property
failed to realize enough to reimburse him for the payment
of the debt, he would lose this deficiency unless
the grantee had assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage.
Whether the mortgagee may sue directly a
grantee of mortgaged premises who has assumed and
agreed to pay the mortgage, is a question which has
been much litigated; but it is now held almost everywhere
that the mortgagee may do so. Sometimes a
succession of grantees, each in turn on buying the
premises, assumes and agrees to pay a certain mortgage.
The mortgagee, in such a case, is generally allowed
to recover from any one of these grantees so
far as is necessary to satisfy his claim; but the ultimate
liability will rest upon the last purchaser who
has assumed the debt. As against a grantee who has
not assumed the debt, the mortgagee has no rights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
He can deprive such a purchaser of his land, so far as
is necessary to collect the debt, but he cannot hold him
personally liable.</p>

<p>FORECLOSURE OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES.&mdash;According
to the original theory of the
law, the mortgagee became the absolute owner of
the mortgaged premises by the failure of the mortgagor
to pay the debt when due, and by the foreclosure
or termination of the mortgagor's right of redemption.
Foreclosure of this character is still possible
in a few States, but in most States it has been wholly
abolished, and everywhere the ordinary method of
foreclosure is by sale of the mortgaged property. Frequently
the sale is made by virtue of an authority or
power of sale given in the mortgage itself, but sometimes
it is made under authority of a decree of court
in foreclosure proceedings. Where a mortgage contains
a power to the mortgagee to sell on default of
the mortgagor, he is acting not simply on his own
behalf but as agent for the mortgagor in transferring
title to the property. The proceeds will be applied
first to the payment of the debt with interest and the
expenses of the sale. Any surplus will be held by the
mortgagee in trust for the mortgagor and must be
paid over to the latter. The situation is entirely analogous
to that created by a collateral note where
stock or other personal property is transferred as collateral
to secure a debt. The statutes of all States
contain regulations in regard to the foreclosure of
mortgages, which must be observed. They are aimed
generally to protect the mortgagor from forfeiture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
his property to any greater extent than is necessary
to insure the payment of the mortgage debt. In any
case of foreclosure the local statute and practice must
be consulted.</p>

<p>DEEDS OF TRUST.&mdash;In some States what are
called deeds of trust have been largely substituted for
mortgages. The temptation to make such a substitution
is greatest in jurisdictions which refuse to recognize
the mortgagee as the legal owner of the premises.
If the law denies the mortgagee this recognition, he
can, by insisting, as a condition of his loan, that the
premises shall be conveyed to a third person as
trustee, achieve the result that the mortgagor at least
is no longer the legal owner of the premises. Essentially
the situation is the same under a deed of trust as
under a common law mortgage. In both cases the
legal title is held merely to secure the debt, and the
court will secure to the debtor all the value of the
property which can be realized from its sale over and
above the amount of the debt. If the debt is paid of
course the debtor is entitled to the return of the security
whether it is real estate or personalty, and
whether held directly by the creditor or by a third
person as trustee.</p>

<p>THE TORRENS LAW.&mdash;The Torrens system
of registration of land titles received its name from
Sir Robert Torrens who drew the first Torrens law
enacted in South Australia in 1858. The practice of
searching titles has gone through this development.
In country districts the person purchasing real estate
frequently accepted the grantor's deed without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
search of the title. Of course, if there were judgments
against the grantor, or other claims against the real
property, the purchaser or the grantee takes the property
subject to these claims. Ordinarily, however,
the careful purchaser employs a lawyer to make a
search of the title before he accepts it and pays the
purchase price. In New York City to-day, and in
some of the other large cities of the country, most of
the title searching has passed out of the hands of the
lawyers into the hands of the title companies. The
title company makes the search now, the same as the
lawyer formerly did, with an added advantage. Suppose
I am to buy Blackacre, and employ attorney
Blackstone to search the title. He reports it as being
free and clear. I take possession and pay the purchase
price. Six months later the wife of the grantor appears
on the scene. When the grantor conveyed, he
stated in the deed that he was single. The wife establishes
the validity of her marriage, and her husband's,
my grantor's, death. She is, of course, entitled
to dower. I am obliged to make some kind of settlement
with her, and there is no way, probably, by
which I can hold my lawyer for failing to find that the
grantor was married, when he made the search for
me. If the title to my property had been searched
for me by a title company, it would have issued a title
insurance policy in my name which would have protected
me, in this instance, and I would have been reimbursed
by the title company for the loss which I
sustained in having to pay the dower claim of my
grantor's wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>ECONOMY OF TITLE SEARCHES.&mdash;Economically,
the title company is a big step in advance
of the former practice of having lawyers make a
search. The title company can do it much cheaper.
If Blackacre was sold, when lawyers alone were making
searches, probably a different lawyer would be
employed at each sale, and he would make a search
back to the earliest deed. After a title company has
made its search, the result is in its records and the
next time it is on the same piece of property, the
search would simply be what is called a continuation,
which would carry the search from the last time the
company was on the title down to the present time.
This enables the title company to make its fee more
reasonable than the lawyer, and we can now secure a
title company's search and insurance policy frequently
for less than formerly was paid to the lawyer
for the search alone.</p>

<p>ESCHEAT.&mdash;However, the policies issued by
the title companies are not absolutely satisfactory,
and the next, and perhaps final, step is for the State to
come in and guarantee the title. This is perfectly
logical. The ownership of all land is in the State,
theoretically, the same as under the English common
law. The King, in those days, owned all the land.
This is more than theory, even to-day. If a man dies,
leaving no heirs and no will, his real property escheats
to the State, this being based simply on the theory
that the property goes back to its original owner, the
State. If this is true, why should not the State insure
the title? This is the theory of the Torrens' system.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>EFFECT OF TORRENS LAW.&mdash;The first
Torrens law, enacted in this country, was in Illinois,
and similar acts have been passed in a number of the
States, including New York. When such laws are on
the statute books, generally the business of a title
company will be legislated out of existence. For that
reason, opposition to the passage of such laws has
developed in some States. Perhaps the next fifty
years may see them generally adopted throughout the
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
Estates and Trusts</h2>


<p>ESTATES.&mdash;When a person who owns property
dies, the first question which arises is as to what
becomes of his estate; who pays the bills, who
takes charge of his business affairs, and what are the
rules as to the division of his property. The first question
a lawyer always asks is, "Did the deceased die
testate or intestate?" that is, did he leave a will or not.
If he left a will, probably he has named one or more
executors in his will to settle his estate, in which case
such person or persons will take charge. If he has
not appointed an executor in his will, an oversight
which rarely occurs, the probate court will appoint
an administrator. If, on the other hand, the man died
intestate, it will be absolutely necessary for the court
to appoint an administrator. The executor will settle
up the estate according to the directions contained in
the will, but if no will was made, the administrator
will settle up the estate according to the rules of the
probate court, under which he is acting, and the property
will be divided in accordance with the statutes of
the State or States having jurisdiction over the estate.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF PROPERTY.&mdash;It is very
essential to distinguish carefully between the two
kinds of property, real and personal, which the deceased
leaves. Real property, as we have explained,
consists of land with the buildings permanently attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
to it, and all other property is personal property,
although it may relate to real property. Thus, a
mortgage on land is personal property, also the shares
of stock in a corporation, although the corporation
may be organized to engage exclusively in the ownership
of real property, is personal property. Where a
person dies leaving a will, his real property goes
directly to the persons to whom he leaves it in the
will. In the case where he dies intestate, his real property
passes directly to his heirs at law, who are designated
by statute. In neither case is any formality
necessary, beyond the probate of the will, to vest the
devisee of the testator or the heirs at law of the intestate
with the title to the real property. The situation
in regard to personal property is quite different.
Where the deceased died leaving a will, his executor
immediately has title to all the personal property. If
he dies intestate, the administrator will take title as
soon as appointed. The personal property is used by
the executor or administrator to pay debts, and the
real property, whether a man dies testate or intestate,
is never used to pay debts unless the personal property
is insufficient.</p>

<p>WILLS DEFINED.&mdash;The definition of Jarman
is commonly used in defining a will: "A will is the instrument
by which a person makes a disposition of his
property to take effect after his decease, and which is,
in its own nature, ambulatory, and revocable during
his life." This definition is open to one criticism. It
does not include oral wills which, as we shall see, are
sometimes legal. We shall also use other terms in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
this chapter which must be defined. A testator is the
man who makes the will, while the testatrix is a
woman making a will. A codicil is a supplement to a
will, made and executed with the same formality as
the original will, and it becomes a part of the original
will, adding to it, or altering it, as the case may be.
A devisee is a person who takes real property under a
will, while a legatee takes personal property under a
will, and the real property passing under the will is
called a devise, and the personal property a bequest.
A legacy refers to money passing under a will. This
is why the ordinary will uses this phrase: "I give,
devise, and bequeath." It is not fatal, however, to
make a mistake of having the will read, "I hereby
devise," referring to personal property. It is more a
mistake in the use of English, than a mistake in law to
make a wrong choice of these terms which we have
just defined. A holographic or olographic will is a
will which is wholly written in the testator's or testatrix's
own hand. The statutes of a few States recognize
these wills as valid without the formal execution
or attestation if they are wholly written, signed, and
sealed by the testator's own hand. A nuncupative will
is an oral will. While most wills must be in writing,
in many jurisdictions the oral wills made by sailors
at sea, and soldiers in actual service are recognized as
valid without being reduced to writing and without
any specified number of witnesses. It is perfectly apparent
why these exceptions are made, because of the
difficulty of securing the materials with which to
make a written will by these two classes of people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Nuncupative wills are good only to dispose of personal
property, unless a special statute has been enacted
which provides otherwise, but this is not commonly
done.</p>

<p>A WILL AND A GIFT CAUSA MORTIS DISTINGUISHED.&mdash;We
have already referred to gifts
causa mortis which are gifts of personal property
made by the donor under apprehension of immediate
death, coupled with the delivery of the property. The
gift is defeated by the recovery of the donor. A gift
causa mortis may be made orally, while, with the exception
of nuncupative wills, all wills must be in writing.
A gift causa mortis must be made under fear of
pending death, whereas a will is ordinarily made with
a view of the fact of death but not of its immediate
happening. Again, delivery is necessary to make a
gift causa mortis, whereas under a will delivery never
takes effect until after the person dies, and then the
legatee's title comes through the executor or administrator,
and not directly from the testator. Real
property is not the subject of a gift causa mortis,
whereas a will may dispose of both real and personal
property.</p>

<p>WHO MAY MAKE A WILL.&mdash;As a general
rule, any person of sound mind and of the age of
twenty-one years may make a will. In some States, a
person eighteen years of age may make a will of personal
property. Formerly a married woman could not
make a valid will excepting in a few instances, but today,
by statute, this common law disability has been
either wholly or largely removed. The statutes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
particular State in which the married woman resides,
or in which her property is situated should always be
consulted.</p>

<p>TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY.&mdash;Another
qualification is that the testator must have sufficient
intellectual powers to enable him to be said to have
"a sound and disposing mind, memory, and understanding."
The case of Whitney v. Twombly, 136
Mass. 145, gives us as good a general statement as
there is concerning the nature of testamentary capacity:
"A testator has a sound mind for testamentary
purposes, only when he can understand and carry in
mind, in a general way, the nature and situation of
his property, and his relations to the persons around
him, to those who naturally have some claim to his
remembrance, and to those in whom, and the things
in which, he has been chiefly interested. He must
understand the act which he is doing, the disposition
which he wishes to make of his property, and the
relation in which he stands to the objects of his bounty
and to those who ought to be in his mind on the occasion
of making his will." The ability to make a
will is not necessarily gone because the testator is old,
weak or ill, even practically at the point of death. The
physical condition is simply significant in determining
the mental condition, but of course a very weak physical
condition does not necessarily mean a weak intellectual
condition. Insane persons are not capable of
making wills, but a person who is insane may still
have a "lucid interval" during which time he is sufficiently
restored to his normal condition to enable him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
to act with such reason as to make a valid will, although
he may, very soon, relapse into his former
insane condition. Ordinarily most peculiarities and
eccentricities on the part of the testator do not affect
his ability to make a will; neither do peculiar religious
beliefs have any effect unless, in any of these cases,
the person's mind is so completely controlled as to
prevent the exercise of rational judgment in disposing
of his property. His eccentricities must amount
almost, in such cases, to a form of insanity to have this
effect.</p>

<p>HOW A WILL MUST BE EXECUTED.&mdash;There
are four requirements for the execution of a
valid will:</p>

<p>(1) It must be in writing.</p>

<p>(2) It must be signed by the testator.</p>

<p>(3) The testator's signature must be made by the
testator or the marking acknowledged by him in the
presence of the necessary number of witnesses.</p>

<p>(4) It must be declared by the testator to be his
last will in the presence of the necessary number of
witnesses, who are present at the same time and who
subscribe their names as witnesses in the presence of
the testator.</p>

<p>OTHER FORMALITIES.&mdash;No particular form
of writing is necessary. Probably typing is the most
common form in use to-day. As a precaution, lawyers
sometimes have the testator sign at the bottom of each
typewritten page, where the will is of several pages,
or the document is fastened together with silk, the
two ends of which are carried to the last page and imbedded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
in a wax seal. The testator should sign the
will himself unless he is unable to, from lack of education
or feebleness, in which case, the statute generally
makes provision for another form of signing. It is
better practice for the testator to sign the will in the
presence of his witnesses, acknowledge the signature,
and then the testator should declare, in the presence
of his witnesses, that this is his last will and testament.
In many States, two witnesses are all that are necessary;
a few States require three. Careful practice
generally calls for three.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;A testator lives in New
York. He has two witnesses to his will. His will is valid
as far as his real property in that State is concerned, but
should it happen that he also owns real property in a
State where three witnesses are required, his will
would not pass title to the real property in that State
and, as far as that State is concerned, he would die intestate,
and that real property would descend to his
heirs in accordance with the laws of that State, which
would quite likely not be what the testator intended to
happen. By having three witnesses, his will is just as
good in New York, where only two are necessary and
the presence of the third witness makes the will good,
and passes the real property situated in the State
where three are required. It is always best to have
the witnesses add their addresses to their signatures.
This is not required by statute in many States, but
after a person's decease, it may help in locating the
witnesses by having addresses to which to refer. It
is, of course, wise to use some care in the selection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
witnesses, although almost any person is competent.
Adults, of course, are preferable as witnesses, but an
infant is a perfectly good witness, but he should possess
sufficient intelligence to be able to appreciate the
importance of the act he is witnessing. In view of the
formalities to be observed in the execution of a will,
and the technical niceties in the use of the proper word
or phrase, often required to insure the expression of
the testator's exact intention, the drafting of a will
should never be left to a layman, but should always be
entrusted to a lawyer.</p>

<p>THE FORM OF A WILL.&mdash;In our discussion
it is well to keep in mind the form of a will. A simple
will reads as follows:</p>

<p>
IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN:<br />
</p>

<p>I, John Jones, of the Borough of Manhattan, City
and State of New York, being of sound and disposing
mind and understanding, do make, publish, and declare
this my last will and testament, as follows:</p>

<p>First. I direct that all of my just debts and my
funeral expenses be paid as soon after my death as
conveniently may be.</p>

<p>Second. I give, devise and bequeath all the rest,
residue and remainder of my estate, whether real,
personal, or mixed, of whatsoever kind, character or
description, and wheresoever situated, unto my wife,
Emma Jones, for and during the period of her natural
life.</p>

<p>Third. Upon the death of my said wife Emma, I
give, devise and bequeath the said residue and remainder
of my estate to my children, Alice Jones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Sarah Jones, and George Jones, to them, their heirs,
executors, administrators and assigns forever, share
and share alike, per stirpes and not per capita.</p>

<p>Fourth. This will shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding children may hereafter be born
to me.</p>

<p>Fifth. I nominate, constitute, and appoint my
said wife Emma, and the Institute Trust Company,
executors of this my last will, giving to them full
power and authority to sell and convey any and all
real estate, whereof I may die seized, at such times and
for such prices as they may consider for the best interests
of my estate.</p>

<p>Sixth. I hereby revoke any and all wills at any
time by me heretofore made.</p>

<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set
my hand and seal this first day of July, 1921.</p>

<p>
(Signed) JOHN JONES (L. S.).<br />
</p>

<p>Signed, sealed, published and declared by John
Jones, the above-named testator, as and for his Last
Will and Testament, in the presence of us, and each
of us, and at the same time declared by him to us, and
each of us, to be his Last Will and Testament, and
thereupon we, at his request, and in his presence and
in the presence of each other, have hereunto subscribed
our names as witnesses, this first day of July,
1921.</p>

</p>

<p>REVOCATION.&mdash;A will may be revoked at any
time at the pleasure of the testator. The ordinary
ways of accomplishing a revocation of a will are:
(1) The testator executes a later will, and in express
terms says, "I hereby revoke all former wills by me
made." Even if such an expression is not put in the
second will, if its terms are wholly inconsistent with
the former will, this in itself, will act as a revocation.
Again, a will may be revoked by mutilation, as by being
burned, torn, or otherwise mutilated by the testator
himself, or in his presence and by his direction.
The mutilation of the will, however, if not accompanied
by an intent thereby to revoke it, is of no effect.
I think I am tearing up an old insurance policy, but
because of poor eye-sight, discover later that I have
torn my will. This would not amount to a revocation
of the will. As has been said by a writer on the
subject of wills, "No amount of cancellation or destruction
without the intent to revoke, and no amount
of intent without the actual destruction, will suffice
to revoke a will. Both the intent and the actual destruction
or cancellation must coexist."</p>

<p>Sometimes changes in the circumstances and conditions
of the testator's life will work a revocation.
For example, at common law, the marriage of a
woman worked an absolute revocation of her will.
This has now been changed in most States by statute.
In a great many States, however, today, if a testator,
having no children, should make his will, and after
the execution of the will, a child is born, the will is
revoked in toto, when no provision for such child is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
made in the will. However, as above stated, this rule
is not uniform in all States, and local statutes should
therefore be consulted on this point. Where a testator
already has children, the birth of additional children
will not affect his will except, that such after-born
children will inherit the same as though he had
left no will. These rules in regard to after-born
children apply only where the will does not make any
mention of possible issue, and for this reason it is well
to insert the clause, in many jurisdictions, providing
that the will shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding
the fact that children may thereafter be
born to the testator.</p>

<p>PROBATE OF WILLS.&mdash;Every State has a
probate court for the settlement of decedents' estates.
Such a court is variously named as the probate court,
the surrogate's court, and the like, according to the
nomenclature adopted in a particular State. Before
an executor named in a will has any authority to act,
he must produce the will, and after the proper proceeding
has been had, the will is admitted to probate,
and he may then qualify under it by giving the necessary
bond. If the deceased died intestate, the proper
person will apply to the probate court for the appointment
of an administrator, and after a hearing,
the court will appoint the person entitled to receive
letters of administration. The administrator will
then qualify, give the necessary bond, and then proceed
with the settling of the estate.</p>

<p>A testator may name anyone in his will as an executor.
In the large cities, in recent years, it is becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
quite common to name a trust company as
executor, because its facilities for handling estates
render it more efficient than the average individual.
If, on the other hand, the testator is unwilling to
place the sole care of his estate in the hands of a
trust company, he may name two executors, a trust
company and his wife, if he is a married man, or a
very close friend in whose judgment he has great confidence,
and, together, the two act as executors. The
fees which the executors receive are generally fixed
by statute. If the deceased dies intestate, the letters
of administration are granted by the court in accordance
with a definite statute. While the law in the various
States is not uniform, generally, the priority of
the right to administration is arranged by statute
something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>(1) On the estate of a husband:</p>

<p>(a) To the widow, if there is any.</p>

<p>(b) If there is no widow, or if the widow renounces,
then to the children.</p>

<p>(c) If there are no children, then to the issue
of deceased children.</p>

<p>(d) If no issue of deceased children, then to
the nearest of kin.</p>

<p>(2) On the estate of a wife:</p>

<p>(a) To the husband, who has an absolute
right. If the husband for any reason does not
desire to act as such administrator, he may
select any fit person to administer the estate.</p>

<p>(b) If there is no husband, then to the children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>(c) If no children, then to the issue of
deceased children.</p>

<p>(d) If no issue of deceased children, then to
the nearest of kin.</p>

<p>(3) On the estate of an unmarried child:</p>

<p>(a) To the father, who has an absolute
right. If for any reason the father does not
wish to act, the court may select any fit person
to administer the estate.</p>

<p>(b) If there is no father, then to the mother
and brothers and sisters, whether of whole or
half blood.</p>

<p>(c) If no mother or brothers or sisters, then
to the nearest of kin in equal degree.</p></blockquote>

<p>PER STIRPES AND PER CAPITA.&mdash;Where
the subject of a testamentary disposition is directed
to be "equally divided" or to be divided "share and
share alike," or where similar words are used which
indicate an equal division among a class of persons, the
persons among whom the division is to be made take
per capita, unless a contrary intention is discoverable
from the will. Where the individuals of a class are
specifically named, or are designated by their relation
to some ancestor living at the date of the will,
whether the testator or another, they take per capita,
unless the context of the will shows an intention that
they should take per stirpes. But where the gift is
to an individual, or several named individuals, and to
others as a class, the latter take per stirpes; unless the
testator uses language indicating an intention that
the members of the class shall share equally with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
named individuals. A gift to a class of persons or on
their death to their heirs or children will be distributed
among such heirs or children per stirpes; but a gift to
one person and the children of other deceased persons
will be divided per capita, unless it appears from the
context or circumstances shown by extraneous evidence
that the testator intended a distribution per
stirpes.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;A gift to children of testator,
A. B. and C., or on their death to their heirs or
children will be distributed, in the event of the death
of C. before the testator, among heirs or children
of C. per stirpes. (In other words, they will divide
the share of their father between them.) But a gift
to A. and to X. Y. and Z., the children of B. deceased,
will be divided per capita.</p>

<p>THE CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS.&mdash;It
sometimes happens that wills are not carefully drawn,
and even if they are, their meaning is not always perfectly
clear. Ordinarily, any person who is interested
in the meaning of a clause of a will may bring a
suit in the proper court asking for a construction of
the will. Of course, each case is governed more or
less, by its own facts, but there are certain general
rules which the courts follow in trying to arrive at
the testator's intent. For example, a will is ordinarily
presumed to speak as of the time of the testator's
death. Thus, reference in a will, to the arrival
of the testator's youngest child at the age of twenty-five
years, will apply to the youngest child at the time
of the testator's death, although such child is born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
after the execution of the will. Ordinarily, a testator
is presumed to have intended to dispose of all of
his property, and if a will can be so construed, this
will be done, rather than to adopt a construction
which will make him testate as to part of his property
and intestate as to another part. If there are two
irreconcilable parts, the latter part is the one which
prevails. Words are to be understood in their ordinary
meaning, unless there is something to clearly
show contrary intent. If, between two possible constructions,
one of which would disclose a legal purpose,
and the other an illegal purpose, the court will
adopt the former.</p>

<p>DOWER.&mdash;Under the rules of the common law,
a wife was entitled, on the death of her husband, to an
estate for life in one-third of the lands of which her
husband was seized of an estate of inheritance at any
time during the marriage. This dower right still
exists in most States, although it may differ in some
particulars. For example, in Connecticut, a dower
right exists only in the real property which the husband
owns at the time of his death, and not, as at
common law, in all the real property of which he was
seized during the whole marriage. Therefore,
reference to the statutes must be made in each State,
to know the exact rule in a particular jurisdiction.
Where the State adheres closely to the common law,
this right, on the part of the wife, is a right of which
her husband cannot deprive her; if the husband disposes
of all his real property in his will to his friend,
John Jones, such disposition is not valid and the wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
would still be allowed her dower right by the probate
court. It must also be borne in mind that dower
refers only to real property. Generally, a husband
may dispose of his personal property without any
reference to his wife. Ordinarily, two things are
necessary to establish the right of dower: (1) A
legal marriage, and (2) seizin by the husband of an
estate of inheritance in lands, or, in a layman's terms,
the absolute ownership of a piece of real estate.</p>

<p>CURTESY.&mdash;Curtesy is the common law right
which a husband has in the real property of his wife,
and by it he is entitled to an estate for his life in all
lands of which his wife was seized during marriage.
Needless to say, women did not take part in law making
when this law arose. To establish this right,
three things are necessary: The two already mentioned
in dower, and third, the birth alive of issue of
the marriage. The right of curtesy does not exist
in this common law form in as many States as does
the right of dower. Where these two rights do exist,
in their more or less modified form, you have the explanation
of the fact that when a married man sells
real property, his wife joins in the deed, or when a
married woman sells real property, her husband joins
in the deed. The act of either in joining, releases the
dower or curtesy right and allows the purchaser to
get a clear title.</p>

<p>CONFLICT OF LAWS.&mdash;We have already referred
to this topic. It frequently happens that a
person dies owning real property located in a number
of States. It is almost certain that the laws covering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
real property will vary in these different States. If
he was a resident of Philadelphia, his will will probably
have been executed in accordance with the laws
of Pennsylvania. The question arises whether such
a will is valid to convey real property which he owns
in New York, California, and Massachusetts. Insofar
as the will affects real property, the mode of execution
and its validity will be controlled by the law
of the jurisdiction in which the real property is
situated. If, then, the will had two witnesses only, as
required by the Pennsylvania law, but three witnesses
are required in one of the other States named, he
would die intestate as far as the real property in the
other State is concerned. Difficult questions sometimes
arise in regard to gifts to charities. Some
States limit the amount which a charitable corporation
may receive as a gift under a will, and other
States require that the gifts must be executed within
a certain time before the decedent's death. Where
there is a question of this character involved only a
careful examination of the decisions and statutes in
the States concerned can furnish the basis for any
satisfactory answer. If there is personal property,
the requisites of validity and construction of a will
are controlled by the law of the testator's domicile.
The question as to his domicile is sometimes quite
difficult to determine and may require a court action.
We have had a number of illustrations of that in connection
with the inheritance tax laws, where the officers
of one State have sought to establish the domicile
of a particularly wealthy person, who has just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
died, within that State in order that they may secure
the inheritance tax for the State, which would of
course, be much larger if the person were adjudged
a resident of that State than it would be if he were
held to be a non-resident.</p>

<p>CONTRACTS TO MAKE A WILL.&mdash;It sometimes
happens that one person may make a contract
whereby he agrees to make a will in favor of another
person. A, 75 years old, and of the proper mental
capacity to make a will, makes a contract with Mary
Jones, that, if she will live in his house and act as
housekeeper as long as he lives, he will make a will
and in it give her his house and $5000. He fails to
make his will and dies suddenly at the end of the year
after the making of this contract. It is generally
recognized that contracts of this nature are valid.
The general rules applicable to contracts apply here.
There must be consideration, the contract must be
certain in its terms, and as such contracts are not
favored by the courts, because they are open to many
forms of fraud, they must be proved by clear and convincing
evidence, and the contract would have to be
in writing under the provisions of the Statute of
Frauds. In the illustration suggested, the further
question arises, what is the remedy on the part of the
housekeeper for a breach of contract. Ordinarily
there are two proceedings open in such a case. The
personal representative of the deceased might be sued
at law to recover damages for a breach of contract, or
one might proceed in equity to compel the parties
who take the legal title to the house, in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
of the failure of the decedent to make his will as he
contracted to do, to convey the property which would
have been conveyed by the will, had the will been
made in compliance with the contract.</p>

<p>TRUSTS DEFINED.&mdash;In Bouvier's Law Dictionary,
trusts are defined as obligations imposed,
either expressly or by implication of law, whereby
the obligor is bound to deal with property, over which
he has control, for the benefit of certain persons of
whom he may himself be one, and any one of whom
may enforce the obligation. A trust arises when property
has been conveyed to one person and accepted
by him for the benefit of another. The person who
holds the property and the legal title is called the
trustee, and the person for whom it is held is termed
the beneficiary or "cestui que trust." Trusts are
created for a great variety of purposes. It is very
common to create them by a will, the testator appointing
a trustee to manage a trust fund which he
sets aside for the maintenance and support of a certain
person or a certain institution. A new device for
creating a trust for the carrying on of a business, seems
to be growing in popularity. The practice apparently
began in Massachusetts with the creation of a trust
for the operation of an office building and similar
undertakings. Under this arrangement, a trust
estate may have transferable shares, exemption of
shareholder's liability, and frequently enjoys peculiar
advantages in taxation matters. These organizations
are sometimes spoken of as common law corporations.
They are so comparatively new that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
closest care should be exercised in operating a business
under this form of organization. We shall now
consider the powers and duties of trustees and include
with them executors and administrators.</p>

<p>TRUSTEES, EXECUTORS, AND ADMINISTRATORS.&mdash;Trustees,
executors and administrators
may be classed together because they are alike
in that they hold legal title to property which is held
by them for the benefit of other persons. They hold
the legal title. A trustee is the owner of the property,
and any one who seeks a transfer of the legal
title of the property must get it from the trustee.
Executors have exactly the same powers as administrators,
aside from powers that may be expressly
given in the will. The difference in name is simply
because an executor is appointed by the will of the
testator, whereas an administrator is appointed by
the court to take charge of an estate for which no
executor has been named in a testator's will, or where
the executor may have died or refused to act, or, the
most frequent case, where the deceased died intestate.</p>

<p>THEIR APPOINTMENT.&mdash;Were it not for
statutes, a trustee or an executor would become such
simply because somebody had made him a trustee or
an executor without any appointment or assistance
from the court. But in the appointment of executors
or trustees, under wills, the court is by statute
generally required to make an appointment to give
validity to a nomination or appointment in the testator's
will. Administrators, of course, from their
very nature, have to be appointed by the court. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
trust, however, may be created between living persons
without any appointment by the court, and
frequently is. A real estate trust may be created by
simply conveying property to trustees on the trust
that they manage it and pay the income to the beneficiaries,
and a great variety of trusts are constantly
created without an appointment from the court.
Wherever any question on a trust arises, or wherever
the appointment of a new trustee is necessary,
however, the court has jurisdiction, and any person
interested in the trust can bring the matter before
the court. When a testator dies the person named
as executor in the will petitions for appointment,
and unless there is some reason why he should not
be appointed he doubtless will be appointed. If
there is no executor, then the persons, or beneficiaries,
interested in the estate, usually agree on someone
to administer the estate, and a petition is filed for
his appointment. The person who is next of kin, and
competent to act, is generally appointed in the absence
of agreement. These officers remain in office
and retain their powers until their work is completed,
unless they are sooner removed, which they may be
at any time for cause.</p>

<p>THEIR POWERS.&mdash;What powers do these
persons have? Do they have power to sell? We
must first always look at the terms of the trust. If
we are dealing with a trustee under a will we look
at the will to see what powers the testator gave him.
If we are looking at a question of a trust under a deed,
we look at the deed, and the right of an executor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
sell real estate similarly depends on whether any
such power has been given him in the will. Aside
from express power given in the instrument, a trustee
has no power to sell either real or personal property
unless the power is expressly given or unless the
nature of the trust is such as necessarily implies the
power, and courts are very slow in construing the
existence of such power by implication. An executor,
on the other hand, since his duty is to reduce
the personal property of an estate to cash, and distribute
it, has, in most States, implied power to sell
personal property. He has, however, no power to
sell real estate unless the will expressly gives such
power. The court may authorize him to sell real
estate, and will authorize him, if it is necessary to
pay debts or legacies, but only in such cases unless
a power is expressly given. Trustees, executors and
administrators have no power to pledge property unless
expressly given in the instrument under which
they act. They have power to make such contracts
as are necessary to carry out their trust, but only
these, and even when they make such contracts they
are personally liable upon them, having, however, a
right of reimbursement from the estate which they
represent. If they entered into an unauthorized
contract they would be liable upon it personally and
have no right of reimbursement.</p>

<p>THEIR DUTIES.&mdash;Their first duty is the care
and custody of the property in their charge. A
trustee, whose duty is to hold property, is bound to
keep it invested so as to bring in an income, whereas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
an executor has no right to invest funds of the estate,
except under the direction of the court; if he does
so he will take the chance of loss, and the beneficiary
can not only hold him liable for loss but can also take
the profit should the investment prove profitable.
The executor's duty is to reduce the property to cash
and distribute it to the proper parties. All these officers
owe the same duty of fidelity to their beneficiary
that an agent owes to his principal. There is the
same duty to execute the trust personally and not
delegate authority, except in regard to ministerial or
mechanical acts. There is the same duty to account,
and furthermore, the accounts of these officers, if
they are appointed by the court, must be filed in court.
The trustee to carry out his trust will ordinarily distribute
the income to the persons entitled, but, of
course, trusts are of great variety, and not infrequently
the object of a trust is to accumulate the
income. Whatever the terms of the trust are they
must be carried out. The duties of the executor and
administrator are to distribute the estate by paying
creditors first and the surplus to legatees or the next
of kin legally entitled. They are allowed a fixed
period, in many States two years, to settle an estate.</p>

<p>One of the most essential duties of any fiduciary
is to keep the property he holds as a fiduciary separate
and distinct from his own. This means that a
trustee or executor receiving current income must
keep a separate bank account as trustee or executor,
and of course he should not draw checks on that fund
for personal debts.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
Carriers and Warehousemen</h2>


<p>CARRIERS WHO ARE PUBLIC SERVICE
COMPANIES.&mdash;Common Carriers&mdash;that is,
railroads, express companies, and other persons
or corporations who carry goods for hire and
hold themselves out to the public as engaged in the
business of carrying goods for anybody for hire&mdash;are
engaged in a public service. A man who owns a tramp
steamer and gets cargoes as he can, is not engaged in a
public service&mdash;he is not a common carrier or public
carrier; but a person who has a line of steamers, or
even one steamer, regularly engaged in plying between
different places and taking goods as offered for
hire, is engaged in public service.</p>

<p>DUTIES OF ONE ENGAGED IN PUBLIC
SERVICE.&mdash;Now, being engaged in public service
subjects a person or corporation who is so engaged to
some special duties. Such a person cannot make any
bargain he pleases with anybody he pleases, and refuse
to make bargains with others, as an ordinary
person can. It is the duty of any one engaged in a
public service to give reasonable service to all who
apply, without discrimination, and for reasonable
compensation. Of course, carriers are not the only
public-service corporations; electric light companies
or gas companies or water companies are other illustrations;
but common carriers, and especially railroads,
are the most prominent public-service corporations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>RAILROAD COMMISSIONS.&mdash;Not only is
there this common-law duty to serve all without discrimination
and at reasonable prices, but both the
States and the United States have established commissions
to look after railroads and other carriers to see
that they properly perform their duties. The Railroad
or Public Service Commission in most States
has a great variety of powers for compelling railroads
to give proper service. The chief function of the
Federal Interstate Commerce Commission originally,
was in regard to rates, but its powers have since been
enlarged by legislation. The Interstate Commerce
Commission has the power concerning interstate commerce
to say whether rates and practices are reasonable.
A carrier is obliged to file with the Interstate
Commerce Commission a schedule of its
rates, and regulations concerning rates, and is also
required to post these rates publicly in its stations.
If anybody objects to the rates they must make complaint
before the Interstate Commerce Commission.
That is the only form of redress, and sometimes not
an easy one for a person who is merely interested in
a single shipment, because the expense and delay of
proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission
are such as to be prohibitive, unless the complainant's
financial interest in the matter is considerable.
It is common, therefore, for shippers' associations
to take that sort of question up rather than to
leave it for individual shippers. Any contract made
by a carrier for either more or less than the scheduled
rate is illegal and void.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>CARRIER'S COMMON-LAW LIABILITY
FOR GOODS.&mdash;A carrier, at common law, when he
receives goods for transportation, is subject to a degree
of liability beyond that imposed on any other
person. An ordinary person who receives goods&mdash;a
bailee, as he is called in law&mdash;is merely liable for the
consequences of his negligence. A carrier, however,
while goods are in course of transportation is liable,
at common law, as an insurer against all kinds of accidents
except those caused by act of God or public
enemies. For instance, if goods were struck by
lightning in transit that would be an act of God, and
the carrier would not be liable; but if goods caught
fire from any other cause, as from neglect of an outsider
or the act of an incendiary, the carrier would be
liable. Carriers, of course, dislike that and try to
contract away their liability. They are allowed by
law to do so, except that they are not allowed to
contract for exemption from the consequences of
their own negligence. It is largely this desire of carriers
to free themselves from the extreme liability
which the common law imposes on them, that induces
them to give bills of lading. Bills of lading are
often required by law, but carriers are pleased to
issue them, as they can in that way contract to exempt
themselves from this extreme liability, which
lasts while the goods are in transit and until the consignee
has had a reasonable time to remove them
from the carrier's possession. If the consignee fails
to remove them with reasonable promptness the carrier
then becomes liable, merely as a warehouseman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
may, for its own neglect. The extreme liability of
the carrier does not extend to damage caused by delay.
The carrier is liable for delays in so far as they
are caused by its own neglect, but otherwise is not
liable. A carrier need not deliver the goods unless
freight is paid, as it has a lien for freight charges.</p>

<p>THREEFOLD NATURE OF BILL OF LADING.&mdash;A
bill of lading issued by a carrier for goods
has a threefold character. In the first place it is a
receipt. The importance of a receipt is as evidence
of just what was shipped. It is important to the
shipper as proof that the carrier received goods, of
such a quantity and of such a description, in good
order. It is important to the carrier as proof of the
same thing, to prevent the shipper from claiming that
he has shipped different kinds or quantities of goods
from those described in the bill of lading. The second
aspect of a bill of lading is as a contract. It is
not only a receipt but a contract between the parties,
the shipper and the carrier. It is as a contract that
the stipulations it contains for limitation, of liability
are important. Third, it is an order, when properly
indorsed and surrendered, for the delivery of the
goods.</p>

<p>CARRIERS CAN DELIVER GOODS ONLY
TO HOLDERS OF ORDER BILLS OF LADING.&mdash;The
thing that makes a bill of lading valuable, to
buy or lend money on, is the fact that the carrier will
hold the goods behind the bill of lading until the bill
is itself presented and surrendered. If the carrier
were to deliver the goods upon demand to anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
other than the holder of the bill of lading, it is obvious
that there would not be much use in holding the
bill of lading. The carriers have made a great contest
on this question in the past. They have contended
that they fulfill their duty if they deliver the
goods to the consignee originally named in the bill
of lading, whether that consignee continues to hold
the documents or not. But that has been decided
against them so far as order bills are concerned (that
is, bills, which state that the goods are deliverable
not simply to a consignee but to the order of a consignee)
and these order bills have printed on them
the provision that the bill itself must be surrendered
before the goods will be delivered.</p>

<p>CARRIERS MAY DELIVER TO CONSIGNEE
OF STRAIGHT BILLS OF LADING.&mdash;In
a straight or flat bill, however (that is, one without
the word "order") the carrier's contention has been
upheld and the carrier is allowed to deliver the goods
to the consignee, even though the consignee does not
present the bill of lading and for all the carrier knows
is not the owner of the bill of lading or of the goods.</p>

<p>BILLS OF LADING USED TO ENABLE
SELLER TO RETAIN HOLD ON GOODS.&mdash;The
ways in which bills of lading may be used, and are
used, in the mercantile world, must be understood
before the legal questions which arise, concerning
them, can be grasped. The primary and original purpose
of using bills of lading as symbols of the goods,
was doubtless to secure the seller in his hold on the
goods until he received the price, and that is still a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
vital purpose in the use of bills of lading. We have
learned, in the case of the sale of goods, that unless
credit is given, the delivery of the goods and the
payment of the price are concurrent conditions.
Now, when the parties reside at a distance there is
difficulty in working out these concurrent conditions.
If the seller ships the goods directly to the buyer, he
loses his hold on the goods, and if the buyer does
not keep his agreement to pay promptly, the seller
will be unable to do anything about it. On the other
hand, of course, the buyer does not want to pay in
advance. Now, by means of bills of lading, the seller
is enabled to keep his hold on the goods until he receives
the price, and the buyer is enabled to secure
possession of the goods as soon as he pays the price.</p>

<p>STRAIGHT BILLS TO BUYER GIVE THE
SELLER NO HOLD ON GOODS.&mdash;The bill of lading
may be used in various ways. Suppose, first, the
seller when he ships the goods takes a straight bill
to the buyer. That will not give the seller any hold,
for the carrier will be discharged if without demanding
the surrender of the bill of lading, he delivers to
the consignee named. So we may cross off that as a
possible means of protecting the seller.</p>

<p>STRAIGHT BILLS TO THE SELLER.&mdash;The
second possibility is for the seller to take a straight
bill, naming himself as consignee as well as consigner.
If that is done the buyer cannot get the goods at once.
Suppose the bill of lading was sent forward, even that
would not of itself enable the buyer to get the goods,
if the carrier wished to be technical, since in a straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
bill the goods are deliverable not to the holder of the
bill, but to the consignee named therein. There would
have to be attached to the bill of lading an order from
the seller, who is named as consignee in the bill, directing
the railroad to deliver the goods to the buyer instead
of to himself, the consignee named in the bill.
That would be a perfectly feasible matter, but this
method is not much used, and one reason why it is
not much used is because the seller frequently wants
to do something else besides keep control of the goods
until the buyer pays for them. He oftentimes wants
to get money from a bank in the meantime.</p>

<p>USE OF BILLS OF LADING BY SELLER
TO OBTAIN LOANS.&mdash;When the seller is desirous
of borrowing money from a bank, he takes the bill of
lading to the bank with a bill of exchange drawn on
the buyer, and he asks the bank at his home town to
discount the bill of exchange, taking as security the
bill of lading. If his home bank does this, it then sends
the draft, with bill of lading attached, to its correspondent
bank in the buyer's city, where the draft is
presented to the drawee, who is the buyer, and if the
buyer honors the draft then he is given the bill of
lading. Now, banks would not do this, ought not to do
it (occasionally they have), with a straight bill, even
if the bill is drawn naming the seller as consignee,
for the bank when it discounts the bill of exchange
and gets the bill of lading as security gets no real
hold on the goods. The railroad may deliver the
goods to the consignee&mdash;the seller&mdash;without ever seeing
the bill of lading, and without the bank, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
holds the bill of lading, ever knowing anything about
it; or the railroad may deliver to the buyer or some
third person on a written order signed by the consignee.
In other words, the railroad does not have to
hold the goods until the bill of lading, properly indorsed,
is presented to it.</p>

<p>STRAIGHT BILLS OF LADING GIVE NO
SECURITY TO BANK.&mdash;The first and fundamental
requirement, then, for any bank which may deal with
bills of lading is never to have anything to do with
straight bills. They give no security. A straight bill
is readily distinguishable from an order bill on railroads
in most parts of the country, at least, because
uniform bills of lading are now in use, and the straight
bill is always white and the order bill is always yellow.
In foreign bills a greater variety of forms are
used, and you may have to examine the terms of the
bill before you can feel satisfied that it is of a sort
that will give security. The vital words in bills of
lading, as in negotiable paper, are the words, "order
of" or "or order." If those are in a bill of lading it
is all right as far as this matter is concerned. Therefore
the third and fourth possible ways in which the
seller may take the bill of lading to secure himself
are the only ones which will enable him to finance the
shipment at once.</p>

<p>BILLS OF LADING TO BUYER'S ORDER.&mdash;The
third way which the seller may act in order to
fulfill his purpose is to take an order bill of lading
to the buyer's order. Although the bill of lading runs
to the buyer's order, and although, therefore, title to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
the goods will pass to the buyer on shipment, the
buyer cannot get the goods without that bill of lading.
Therefore, so long as the seller retains the bill of lading
nobody can get the goods from the carrier; and
though the seller has parted with title to the goods,
since he made the bill of lading run to the buyer's
order, still he has retained control of them. Though
it gives a security to the seller, and would give
security to the bank, if the bank discounted a bill
of exchange drawn on the buyer and took this
bill of lading as security, it is not a desirable method
for this reason: though the buyer cannot get the goods
without the bill of lading, nobody else can get the
goods without a lot of trouble, unless he has not only
the bill of lading but the buyer's indorsement upon it.
The bill of lading is drawn to the buyer's order, and
if the buyer fails to pay and repudiates his contract,
the bank or the seller will have trouble in getting back
the goods. They will have to prove to the railroad
that the buyer really has made default and that he no
longer has any real interest in the goods.</p>

<p>BILLS OF LADING TO THE SELLER'S ORDER.&mdash;Accordingly,
it is the fourth method which is
in general use and which should be exclusively used.
The seller takes the bill of lading to his own order and
indorses it in blank; then he delivers it to his
bank as security for a bill of exchange. If the bill of
exchange is paid by the drawee on presentment at
his city, he is given the bill of lading at once and he
gets what he wants. On the other hand, if the buyer
does not pay the draft on presentment, then the bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
can realize on the security at once, if it wants to,
because it has a bill of lading in its hands indorsed by
the consignee to whose order it was drawn. If the
bank proceeds against the seller as the drawer of the
draft, when the latter pays and takes up the bill of
lading he can similarly realize on the security, or get
the goods back, because he will have a bill of lading
in his possession which runs to his own order.</p>

<p>BILLS OF LADING TO "ORDER NOTIFY."&mdash;A
slight modification of this form of bill of lading is
made in order to let the buyer know when the goods
arrive. When goods arrive at their destination it is
a customary courtesy of railroads to notify the consignee;
but if goods are consigned to the seller's order,
the man who is really trying to buy the goods gets no
notice, as his name does not appear on the bill of lading.
To avoid that difficulty there is generally put
on bills of lading, taken out to the seller's order when
the goods are shipped in fulfillment of some contract
or order, the words, "Notify X Y," X Y being the
prospective buyer of the goods. Then when the goods
arrive the railroad notifies X Y; he learns the goods
are there and makes his plans accordingly. These
bills of lading are often called "bills to order notify."
The person who is to be notified is sometimes incorrectly
called the consignee of the bill. The consignee
is the person to whom the goods are deliverable, not
the person who is to be notified necessarily; and where
a bill is to the seller's order the goods are, by the
terms of the bill of lading, deliverable to the seller and
he is the consignee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>CROPS ARE MOVED BY USE OF BILLS OF
LADING.&mdash;The various uses of bills of lading by sellers
in order to insure concurrent payment by the
buyer, and in order, with the aid of banks, to put themselves
in funds while the goods are in transit, is a very
important function of bills of lading. It is by such
means the great crops of the country are moved, especially
the cotton crop, which is moved almost
wholly in this manner. The southern banks discount
bills of exchange, which are customarily secured by
bills of lading. The New York banks rediscount these
bills of exchange and draw for a great part of the
price of the cotton on English bankers. This use by
sellers of bills of lading, however, is not the only mercantile
use of bills of lading.</p>

<p>BILLS OF LADING TO BANKER'S ORDER.&mdash;Here
is another method used, especially common in
foreign commerce. A merchant in Boston wants to
buy a cargo of goods from Europe, but he has not the
money to do it. The seller in Europe does not know
him and will not give him credit, so the merchant goes
to bankers who have available foreign correspondents
and states his case, and if he is in good credit with the
bankers they say, "Order the goods from the man in
Germany of whom you were planning to order them,
and tell him to make the bill of lading out to us, and
draw on us or on our correspondents in Berlin or
London or Paris. On receipt of those bills of lading
naming us as consignee we will pay, or cause to be
paid, the bills of exchange attached thereto for the
price." In this way the goods are shipped directly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the banker. In the cases mentioned before, the banker
took an indorsed bill of lading, but in this mode of
dealing the banker is himself the consignee, and on the
faith of the consignment he pays the price of the
goods. Then he delivers the bill of lading, indorsed,
to the buyer, his customer, on the buyer's making a
settlement or giving him security.</p>

<p>SURRENDER OF BILLS OF LADING FOR
TRUST RECEIPTS.&mdash;There is one method of doing
business in this connection which causes some risk to
the bankers who engage in it. They frequently allow
their customer, the buyer, to take the bill of lading,
indorsed, for the purpose of entering the goods at the
Custom House, or warehousing them, or even for the
purpose of selling the goods, so that the buyer will
be in funds to enable him to discharge his debt to the
banker. The banker takes, when he does this, from
the buyer to whom he delivers the indorsed bill of
lading, what are called "trust receipts." These receipts
state that the buyer has taken these bills of lading,
that he holds them as a trustee, that they really
belong to the banker, and that the buyer holds them
simply for a special purpose, such as to enter them
at the Custom House or to resell them and turn the
proceeds over to the banker. If the buyer is honest,
well and good; but if he should be financially pressed
and dispose of that bill of lading, many courts, at
least, would not protect the banker, but would protect
the bona fide purchaser. What the banker ought
to do is to stamp upon the bill of lading, if he delivers
it to the buyer, that a trust receipt has been issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
for certain specified purposes. In that case any purchaser
of the bill of lading would have notice of the
terms of the trust.</p>

<p>CHANGE OF ROUTING.&mdash;An analogous problem
also may be supposed. A bank holds a draft for
collection with bill of lading attached. It sometimes
allows the drawee to take possession of the bill of
lading and change the routing of the car. That is
done because the buyer sometimes sells the goods before
he receives them, and to save additional freight
bills, he changes the routing on the original bills of
lading. What risk does the bank run if it allows him
to have possession of the bill of lading indorsed in
blank? It runs the same risk as in case of trust receipts.
The fact that the purpose was to change the
routing of the goods is apparently immaterial. The
change of destination does not do the bank any actual
harm, except that the goods will be sent elsewhere,
and perhaps to a point some distance from
their original destination. The great risk involved is
in allowing a man to have possession of a document
which in effect is negotiable. If the bank does not
get back its bill of lading it is in a bad position. If it
did get back its bill of lading it would still have its
security, only it would be subject to this difficulty,
that the goods instead of coming to a place where the
bank could conveniently get at them, have perhaps
gone to a distant city, where it would be more trouble.
If, however, changing the routing and the reselling
involve a surrender of the old bill to the railroad and
the issuing of a new bill of lading not only on a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
route but with the purchaser from the consignee
named as a new consignee, then the bank has thrown
away everything, unless it actually obtains possession
of the new bill, and even if it does it has only an inferior
security.</p>

<p>ACCOMMODATION BILLS.&mdash;Let us now
enumerate the risks which a purchaser or a lender
runs in dealing with bills of lading, even with order
bills, and consider how these risks can be obviated and
how far they are inherent in the nature of the business.
The first risk is that the bill may have no goods
behind it, because it was originally issued without any
goods. It has been quite a common practice, at some
points where there is competition for freight, to accommodate
customers by issuing a bill of lading for
goods before the goods were received. Suppose a
seller in Chicago deals with a man in Boston; what
the seller normally ought to do is to buy goods, and
ship them, getting a bill of lading, then take the bill of
lading to a bank and get money on the faith of that
bill of lading. You will see that that method requires
the seller to have had money or credit in the
first place, in order to buy those goods to ship. It
would be very much more convenient for him if he
could reverse the order and get the money from the
bank first, then buy the goods and then ship them;
and the kindness of the railroad agent frequently has
enabled him to do that. The railroad agent, trusting
to the seller's word that he will ship goods to-morrow,
issues a bill of lading to him for the goods which the
seller promises to ship. The seller dashes around to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
the bank, gets money and then buys the goods and
ships them. He may carry on business in that way
for a long time; no trouble occurs, nobody knows anything
about it until the seller either goes bankrupt or
becomes dishonest and fails to ship the goods after
he has got the bill of lading, and then somebody finds
himself with a bill of lading for which no goods have
ever been received. Such bills have been called "accommodation"
bills of lading, issued by the railroad
for the accommodation of the shipper.</p>

<p>FICTITIOUS BILLS OF LADING.&mdash;In some
cases the whole transaction is a fraud. In the case we
have thus far been supposing, the railroad agent believed
the seller was going to ship goods, and the
seller intended to do so, only he wanted the bill of
lading first; but money is so easily obtained, frequently,
on bills of lading, that sometimes a shipper and a
railroad agent put their heads together and say, "Let's
make a few bills of lading," and as a pure fraud the
agent writes bills of lading. These may be called
fictitious bills. They are not exactly forgeries, you
will see, since they are drawn by the regular agent of
the railroad on the regular railroad form. One who
took such a bill as this, however, would be protected
if the carrier were liable. Railroads are generally,
and other carriers are generally, financially responsible,
and therefore the great question that interests
the holder of such a bill is, are the railroads liable in
damages because no goods are behind the bill of lading?
It was held in an English case, seventy-five
years ago, that in such a case the carrier was not liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
on the ground that the agent who wrote the bill was
acting beyond the scope of his authority in signing a
bill of lading when no goods had been received. That
decision has been much criticized, and justly criticized,
because the carrier has put that agent in a position
to determine when bills of lading shall be issued
and when not. Of course, the agent ought to exercise
his choice properly, but if the carrier has given him
the power it ought to be responsible for the results.
Nevertheless, in a majority of the States of this
country, and in the Supreme Court of the United
States, the English case has been followed; and the
carrier would be liable neither on an accommodation
bill nor a fictitious bill where no goods were shipped.
There have been some attempts to change this rule
by statutes, and in some States there is a statute, the
Uniform Bill of Lading Act, so called, which provides
among other things that the carrier shall be liable in
the case supposed; but the trouble is that bills of
lading dealt with in one State will not generally originate
in that State. If a fictitious bill was issued in
Chicago, although the bill named as a consignee a
person in Boston, and was bought by a Boston bank,
the liability of the carrier on that bill of lading would
be determined by the law of Illinois. So, unless you
have a satisfactory law where the bill originates, you
will not be protected. Fortunately, the same statute
has been passed in several States, and it is hoped that
it will be in more. This, then, is the first risk, and the
only way of obviating it is to have the law in satisfactory
shape, passing a statute wherever it is necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
so as to make the carrier liable for the wrongful
act of its agent in issuing a bill of lading when no
goods have been received.</p>

<p>GOODS BEHIND BILL OF LADING INFERIOR
IN KIND OR QUALITY.&mdash;The second
difficulty is somewhat analogous to the first. Suppose
there are some goods behind the bill of lading
but they are not of the quantity, quality or kind that
the bill of lading specifies. This is a difficulty that
cannot very well be wholly obviated. We may suppose
that the goods originally were of defective quality
and kind, or that they became so. Suppose, first,
that a number of barrels of sand are delivered to a
railroad and they are marked barrels of sugar, and
the carrier issues a bill of lading for so many barrels
of sugar. Now, the purchaser of the bill of lading
finds, when he comes to realize on his security, that he
has got barrels of sand with a freight bill against them
for more than they are worth. What can he do? Of
course, he has a right of action against the fraudulent
shipper, but perhaps the shipper has run away or is
irresponsible. Is the carrier liable here? The answer
to this is, no. In the first place, the bill of lading says,
"Contents and condition of contents unknown," so
that the carrier has expressly guarded against promising
that the barrels really contained sugar. And
even aside from this clause, it has been held that the
carrier is not liable for such a concealed defect. If,
however, it was apparent when the carrier received
the goods that they were not of the kind or quality
named, then the carrier would be liable if it issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
a bill of lading without specifying the difficulty.
Thus, if the bill of lading called for 100 barrels of
sugar and there were 95, the carrier would be liable for
the missing five. It has admitted it received 100,
and has promised to deliver 100; it must do so or be
liable.</p>

<p>SHIPPER'S LOAD AND COUNT.&mdash;There is
an exception to this last statement, however, in regard
to one class of bills which are very common in some
lines of trade; these are "shipper's load and count"
bills. In many cases railroads build spur tracks to
factories and run empty cars up to the factories, where
the shipper loads the cars and himself writes out the
bill of lading. An enormous fraction of the business
of the country, consisting of the large shipments from
factories, at any rate, is done in this way. The railroad
agent simply signs a bill of lading as it is presented
to him by the shipper who has made out the
whole bill except the signature, and has loaded the
car, the railroad agent seeing nothing of it. The
railroad agent stamps across such a bill of lading,
"Shipper's load and count." That means, "The shipper
loaded this car and counted the contents. We are
not responsible, therefore, for the loading or the
counting." The second great principle, in regard to
lending money on bills of lading, is never to touch a
shipper's load and count bill which obviously has not
the responsibility of the carrier. You would have to
rely wholly on the honesty of the shipper. The railroads,
seeing that they are freed from liability on this
form of bill, have sometimes, in some parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
country, thought it would be a good thing to stamp
every bill, "Shipper's load and count." That is an
injury to the shipper, because the banks do not like to
take such bills of lading, and yet not infrequently he
cannot do much about it. In fruit shipments from
California that sort of thing has been very common.</p>

<p>DESTRUCTION OF GOODS IN TRANSIT.&mdash;So
much for defects arising at the time of shipment;
but one may also have difficulties which arise after
the shipment. Suppose the goods are absolutely destroyed
in transit by any of a variety of causes. The
owner of the bill of lading necessarily loses his security,
unless under the bill the carrier is responsible for
that particular kind of loss. But it may happen that
the carrier is not responsible for that particular kind
of loss. One may protect himself here, perhaps, by
insurance of some kind. That would be the way to
obviate this sort of risk, but if complete protection
against this kind of risk is desired, the insurance
ought to be not only against fire but against destruction,
or really against deterioration in any form. Of
course, goods which are likely to depreciate in transit
are not as good security as goods which are more durable.
A cargo of bananas is not as good security as
a cargo of grain.</p>

<p>LACK OF TITLE IN SHIPPER.&mdash;A third risk,
which any one who takes a bill of lading runs, is lack
of title to the goods in the shipper. Suppose the
shipper stole the goods and brought them to the carrier
and demanded and received an order bill of lading.
That looks like as good a bill of lading as any, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
goods may be all right, but the holder of the bill of
lading cannot keep the goods. They still belong to
the original owner from whom the shipper stole them.</p>

<p>SPENT BILLS.&mdash;A fourth risk is that the bill
of lading may be a "spent bill," as it is called. A spent
bill is one where the goods have been delivered by the
carrier at destination, but the bill of lading has not
been taken up. A bill of lading is unlike a note in this
respect&mdash;it has no date of maturity. When you buy a
promissory note you can guess whether it has been
dishonored or not, by whether the time for performance
has come or not; but if a bill of lading for a cargo
of goods is offered to you, you have no means of telling
whether the cargo arrived the day before or
whether the goods have been removed. Of course,
the carrier ought to take up an order bill of lading
when the goods are delivered, and in the Uniform Bills
of Lading Act that requirement is made, and the carrier
is made liable on the bill if it is left outstanding
and is purchased by a bona fide purchaser for value,
who supposes that the goods are still in transit. This
trouble with spent bills is not so likely to arise as a
corresponding difficulty with what may be called "partially
spent bills." It is not uncommon for partial
delivery to be made and the bill of lading still left in
the hands of the holder. Commonly, when all the
goods are delivered, the bill of lading is taken up, but
when part is delivered the carrier does not feel justified,
and indeed is not justified, in demanding the surrender
of the bill. What ought to be done, of course,
is to indorse on the bill of lading the fact that part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
the goods has been delivered, with a specification of
the part. This also is required by the bill of lading
statute, and a carrier is made liable for failure to indorse
on a bill of lading the fact that part of the goods
described therein has been delivered.</p>

<p>LACK OF TITLE TO BILLS OF LADING.&mdash;A
fifth risk, which one who buys or lends money on
bills of lading runs, is the chance that the person from
whom he takes a bill of lading may not have title to it.
This risk is the same that one runs in regard to negotiable
paper. If an indorsement is forged, or if for any
reason the holder of a bill of lading&mdash;or for that matter
of a bill of exchange&mdash;cannot give a good title to
it, one who purchases from him will not get a good
title.</p>

<p>MEANING OF NEGOTIABILITY.&mdash;The extent
of this risk depends somewhat on the degree of
negotiability which is given to bills of lading, and
requires an understanding of what negotiability
means. Ordinarily, one who buys a contract right
gets no better right than has the person from whom
he buys it. On the other hand, though one who buys
chattel property capable of delivery, like a horse or a
book, does not get title if the person who sold it to
him had no legal title, yet a purchaser does get a good
title to such property if he buys, in good faith and for
value, from a person who has legal title though not
an equitable title. You will see this best by an illustration.
If a fraudulent person has a contract right
assigned to him by fraud, and then sells the contract
right to a bona fide purchaser, the bona fide purchaser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
gets no greater right than the fraudulent person has;
in other words, he cannot collect on the claim which
he has obtained. On the other hand, if a fraudulent
person has assigned to him, by fraud, a horse or a
book, the legal title to which was in the assignor, he
has acquired the legal title, and though he is subject
to an equity, as the phrase is, and the horse or the
book could be taken away from him by the defrauded
person, if he could act quickly enough, yet a purchaser
for value, without notice of fraud, will get an indefeasible
legal and equitable title to the horse or the book.</p>

<p>Negotiable paper&mdash;like bills of exchange and
promissory notes&mdash;is subject to the same rule as the
horse or book, and is not subject to the same rule as ordinary
contract rights; that is, a purchaser in good
faith of an order bill of lading from a vendor having
legal title thereto, will get title to it and to the goods
behind it, in spite of the fact that the person from
whom the bill of lading was bought had obtained title
by fraud, and could have had the bill of lading, or the
goods behind it, taken away from him by the person
defrauded.</p>

<p>Another feature of negotiability is that the terms
of the instrument, on the face and back, are regarded
as definitely showing the title. If the instrument is
made to A's order, A has power by indorsement to
give a good title, whatever may have been the reason
the instrument was made payable to A, and even
though it was agreed by the original parties that A
should be merely an agent and have no title or right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
to transfer. If the instrument is made out on its face
to bearer, or is indorsed in blank by the person to
whom it is made out on the face, anyone acting in good
faith may treat the holder as the owner and acquire
a good title from him, though in fact the holder may
not have had a good title. Under the Uniform Bills
of Lading Act, and under some other local statutes,
bills of lading running to order are given full negotiability,
but in many States they are only partially
negotiable.</p>

<p>INDORSEMENT OF BILLS OF LADING.&mdash;Order
bills of lading need, for their negotiation, indorsement
by the consignee, just as a promissory note
needs indorsement by the payee. But there is one difference
between the indorsement of a bill of lading, it
may be said in passing, and the indorsement of a promissory
note. The indorser of a bill of lading incurs no
liability by his indorsement. His indorsement is simply
a transfer. If it turns out that the bill of lading
is not honored by the carrier, the holder of an indorsed
bill of lading cannot come back on the indorser in the
way that the holder of a promissory note can come
back on the indorser if the maker fails to pay.</p>

<p>FORGED BILLS OF LADING.&mdash;One final risk
in regard to bills of lading is that the bill of lading
may be forged or altered, and this has in practice
proved the most serious risk of all. There have been,
in times past, several sets of frauds created by forged
bills of lading. One of the largest is known as the
Knight-Yancey frauds which originated in Alabama.
A cotton firm named Knight, Yancey &amp; Co. forged a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
quantity of bills of lading and obtained a very large
amount of money from banks. A circumstance that
renders forgery easier in the case of bills of lading
than in the case of any other valuable document, such
as a check or a stock certificate, is the carelessness
with which bills of lading have been made out. It is
really incredible, the carelessness with which this has
been done. Documents which represent a value of
many thousands of dollars are scribbled hastily, in
pencil sometimes, on forms that are accessible to anybody.
The forgeries that have taken place have called
attention to this evil, and at the present time there is
more care exercised in making out order bills than
was the case a few years ago; but even to-day an order
bill of lading is made out with no special precautions
against forgery. The forms can be obtained at any
railroad station, and it is simply a question of copying
writing, no devices of perforating or serial numbers
or things of that sort being ordinarily used.</p>

<p>DEVICES TO PREVENT FORGERY.&mdash;In
order to meet this risk several devices have been suggested.
One which has been urged upon Congress is
to pay the railroads a special small fee for issuing order
bills with the precautions that a stock certificate is
issued. The railroad would take the blank from a
numbered book and would punch and stamp it in such
ways and with such countersigning that it would be
very difficult to forge. That method has not found
much favor with shippers because they dislike the
extra expense. They get their order bills of lading for
nothing now, and they want to continue to do so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
Another project is to make some sort of central clearing
house to which shall be reported all order bills of
lading as they are issued, so that it will be known
whether there is outstanding a document corresponding
to one that is offered to a bank for security. This
method is to some extent in use.</p>

<p>ALTERATION OF BILLS OF LADING.&mdash;Alteration
of a genuine bill may be as damaging as the
out and out forgery of a new one. This case occurred
in Maryland some years ago: a man who had always
been in good repute had a line of credit at the bank,
where he kept, as security, bills of lading. He was
allowed to change these as he wanted to, putting in
sufficient collateral always to cover what he took out.
The railroad and steamboat lines with which he did
business neglected in some instances to take up the
bills of lading which he presented for shipments. They
habitually did not take up the straight bills, and that
is not required by law, and sometimes they did not
take up the order bills. When this man got hard
pressed he took some old order bills, which he still
had in his possession, and changed the dates; then he
took some straight bills which he had in his possession
and changed the date of those, and also added
the words "or order" to the name of himself as consignee.
Then, after indorsing those they looked good.
He took those altered bills to his bank and substituted
them for genuine bills, and when the fraud was found
out the bank found itself with about $100,000 of altered
bills of lading. The carrier was held liable on
the order bills, even though they had been altered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
because it should have taken them up, but on the
straight bills, which were a great part of the whole,
the bank lost. Of course, they were still legally
straight bills, although the holder had written "or
order" on them. That fraud led to one protection
being made in the uniform bill of lading recommended
by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The uniform form of order bill has the words "order
of" printed in front of the blank for the consignee's
name, so that a straight bill cannot be made into an
order bill by adding "or order." Moreover, the difference
in color, between order and straight bills now
gives a protection as to domestic bills; not as to foreign
bills, however. If a bill is altered fraudulently
the bill is worth just as much and just as little as it
would have been worth if no alteration had been
made; that is, the alteration, not the bill itself, is void.</p>

<p>ATTACHMENT OF GOODS IN TRANSIT.&mdash;There
is one other risk in regard to bills of lading
which no longer exists where the Uniform Bills of
Lading Act is in force, and that is seizure by attachment
for the benefit of some creditor. The bills of
lading act provides that when there is an order bill
outstanding, against goods shipped by a carrier, there
can be neither attachment by a creditor nor stoppage
in transit by the seller if unpaid. Where the uniform
statute has not been passed, the matter is not so clear.
Undoubtedly one who purchased for value or lent
money on an order bill would be protected against
later attachments by creditors of the former owner
of the bill; but if creditors of the former owner had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
attached the goods prior to the transfer of the bill, the
attachment would generally be held good, though the
man purchasing or lending money on the bill knew
nothing of the attachment.</p>

<p>WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS ARE SIMILAR
TO BILLS OF LADING.&mdash;To what has been said in
regard to bills of lading a few words in regard to warehouse
receipts may be added. Warehouse receipts are
entirely similar in character to bills of lading, and
what has been said in regard to them is, in general,
applicable to warehouse receipts. There is a Uniform
Warehouse Receipts Act which is similar in its provisions
to the Uniform Bills of Lading Act, and the
Warehouse Receipts Act has been enacted in a majority
of the States. Warehouse receipts may be, in form,
order or straight. They are simpler in form, ordinarily,
than bills of lading, because they do not have
so many special stipulations and conditions, but in
other respects they are practically identical. The risks
that one who deals in them runs are the same in their
nature as in the case of bills of lading. There is one
circumstance, however, in regard to warehouse receipts
that gives one a better chance to protect himself
than in bills of lading. Warehouse receipts are
generally used as collateral and for purchase and sale
in the city where the goods are stored. It is therefore
possible to telephone to the warehouseman or otherwise
to assure oneself of the existence of the goods in
a way that is not possible under the bill of lading,
where the goods are in transit. The warehouse receipt,
even less than a bill of lading, has a day of maturity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
A bill of lading, as we have seen, has no particular
day on which it is evident to a purchaser that
it has finished its work, and that is even more true in
a warehouse receipt. The fact that a warehouse receipt
is pretty old does not necessarily show that the
document is not a perfectly good document and that
the goods are not there.</p>

<p>OPEN RECEIPTS.&mdash;There is one way of doing
business with warehouse receipts which is different
from anything that takes place with bills of lading,
and which has been a subject of criticism, and which
deserves criticism; this is the practice of issuing what
are called open receipts. In an open receipt the warehouseman
acknowledges he has received a certain
quantity of things of a certain sort, and will redeliver
that quantity of things of that sort; but not necessarily
the identical things that were deposited. It is
contemplated that the depositor shall have the right
to substitute from time to time, for the goods originally
deposited, other goods of like kind and quantity;
that is, a receipt may be issued for 100 bales of
burlap. The depositor who deals in burlap wants to
use some of the bales that are in storage. He has
pledged his warehouse receipt, which he originally
received for the 100 bales of burlap, and he cannot
surrender that, but he wants the warehouseman to let
him take out 25 bales of the old burlap and put in 25
bales of new, and that is sometimes allowed. It seems
a very unsafe practice. It is unsafe, for one who lends
on warehouse receipts, to allow the depositor and the
warehouseman to agree between themselves as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
what shall be a sufficient substitution for goods which
are the bank's collateral. Moreover, it is unsafe for the
warehouseman, because if the holder of the warehouse
receipt has not really consented to the substitution,
or unless the form of warehouse receipt clearly shows
that substitution is contemplated, the warehouseman
would be liable to the holder of the receipt if the substituted
goods turn out to be inferior to those which
were originally deposited.</p>

<p>WAREHOUSEMAN IS A BAILEE FOR
HIRE.&mdash;A warehouseman is a bailee for hire, and a
bailee for hire is liable for neglect if the goods are
destroyed or injured by his negligence. He is not
an insurer. The ordinary bailee for hire is not subject
to the extraordinary liability to which a carrier is
subjected while goods are in transit.</p>

<p>SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANIES ARE
BAILEES FOR HIRE.&mdash;There is one special kind
of bailee, in regard to whom it may be worth while to
say a few words particularly, and that is a safe deposit
company. It has been questioned whether a safe
deposit company is properly a bailee of the goods in
the boxes to which the safe deposit company does not
have access. It is simply in control of the general
premises, and, furthermore, the holder of the boxes
cannot have access to what is inside the boxes without
the assistance of the safe deposit company. There
is, therefore, a sort of joint possession. The safe deposit
company and the depositor who hired the box
have together the full control of the goods, but neither
one of them alone has it. It has been suggested that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
the safe deposit company is merely a sort of watchman;
that it is guarding property of which it is not in
possession. But it is doing a little more than guarding,
and it is generally held to be a bailee for hire; that
means it must take reasonable care of the goods in
its possession.</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANIES
FOR LOSS OF GOODS.&mdash;There are a number
of cases, not a great many, but still some, where
safe deposit companies have been sued for goods
which were missing, or which the depositor swore
were missing, from his box. If the court or jury is
convinced that the goods have been lost from the box,
the burden of explanation as to how it happened would
be upon the safe deposit company. The safe deposit
company is liable for the acts of its servants and
agents. Of course, then, carelessness in regard to
duplicate keys of any of the boxes might render a
safe deposit company subject to suit if loss occurs
thereby.</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF DEPOSITED GOODS TO
GARNISHMENT.&mdash;One of the most important
questions in regard to safe deposit companies is this:
Are the goods in the safes subject to legal process?
Suppose a safe deposit company is garnisheed (that
is served with a trustee writ) in a suit against some
one who has a box; can the company answer that it
has no funds or goods of the defendant in its possession?
Yes, it may; it cannot control the goods and it
may answer, no funds. One case, however, must be
distinguished, and that is where a bank or a safe deposit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
company has a separate trunk or box of a depositor
in its possession. If it has that separate box,
even though it is locked, and the bank has not the key,
the bank cannot answer no funds; it must answer
that it has a box the contents of which are unknown
to it. A box, however, shut up in a safe deposit vault,
that is, one of the regular tin safes, cannot be reached
by the safe deposit company in the normal course of
affairs, unless the depositor unlocks his lock. That is
the reason for distinguishing between such a box and
an ordinary box or trunk which is not itself enclosed
in something, to which the bank or safe deposit company
does not have access.</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF DEPOSITED GOODS TO
ATTACHMENT.&mdash;Whether property in a safe deposit
company is liable on a writ of attachment in a
suit against the owner, is not so clear. It has been
held in one case that it is so liable, and that the officer
has a right to go in and seize the goods. This will not
often be attempted, however, because the officer will
not know in what box the debtor might have goods,
and the safe deposit company will not tell him. The
company is certainly under no obligation to help the
officer. The regular way for a creditor to get at the
goods of his debtor, concealed in the safe deposit box,
is by first making the debtor disclose on examination
in court what property he has, and then getting an
order from the court that the debtor shall turn over
what he has disclosed. This he must do or be imprisoned
until he does. There is only one difficulty
with this remedy, and that is that the debtor may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
have an infirm memory&mdash;in other words, he may commit
perjury; he may have something in the box and
not disclose the fact.</p>

<p>SEARCH FOR STOLEN PROPERTY.&mdash;If
stolen property were sought, a search warrant describing
the property might be presented to the safe
deposit company, and it would have to permit the officer
of the law to make the search for the goods described,
but only for goods described in the search
warrant. There is a case in New York where, on a
search warrant for certain articles, the officer of a safe
deposit company allowed the officer of the law to make
a general examination of goods in its possession, and
to remove some bonds which were not specified in the
search warrant. The safe deposit company was held
liable.</p>

<p>DEATH OF DEPOSITOR.&mdash;The question
often arises: What is the situation on the death of the
owner or renter of a safe? It is the same as in the case
of the death of any bailor or depositor. The bailee
must recognize the title only of the person who is
appointed by law as the successor in interest to the
deceased person. The safe deposit company has the
right, and should exercise it, to demand proofs and
identifications of persons who claim rights as representing
deceased persons. Sometimes a dispute arises
between joint owners of a box. In that case the only
safe course for a safe deposit company would be to
recognize the right of none until it had been passed
on by the court. What is called a bill of interpleader,
to determine which one has the right, should be filed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
in court, unless the conflicting interests can agree or
one of them gives a bond to the company to insure its
freedom from liability if it delivers the goods to him.</p>

<p>SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANY HAS NO LIEN.&mdash;A
safe deposit company has no lien on the contents
of a box for anything due to it. In that respect it is
different from an ordinary warehouseman and a carrier,
who have a lien on the goods in their possession
for their charges. The reason is that a safe deposit
company is not in such possession of the contents of
a box as to give it a lien. If the renter of the box does
not pay his bills, however, the company has the right
to open the box and remove its contents, keeping them
safe for the owner.</p>

<p>GIFT OF GOODS IN A SAFE DEPOSIT
BOX.&mdash;It was held in a case, decided in the State of
Illinois, that the gift of the keys of a safe deposit box
amounted to a valid gift of property in the box when
made with that intention. In order to make a good
gift there must be a valid delivery, and it was held
that the delivery of the keys amounted to a symbolic
delivery of the contents of the box.</p>

<p>RIGHT OF SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANY TO
SUE FOR GOODS WRONGFULLY TAKEN.&mdash;If
goods are wrongfully removed from the box of a
depositor, the safe deposit company has a right to
reclaim them like any bailee, for it is the law that if
goods are taken out of the hands of a carrier, warehouseman
or other bailee wrongfully, the bailee may
reclaim the goods from the wrongdoer, and bring an
action at law for them, not as owner, but because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
bailee has the right of possession to them while in his
custody, and he may be liable if he lets them get into
the hands of any one other than the true owner.</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANIES
UNDER INHERITANCE TAX LAWS.&mdash;One
case in regard to the Illinois inheritance tax law
indicates an imposition of some burden on the safe
deposit company. The company is required to notify
the Attorney-General ten days before it allows access
by the representative of a deceased person to his box,
and under certain circumstances the safe deposit company
is required to retain, from the contents of the
box, a sufficient amount to pay the tax, and is made
liable if it fails to do so. This provision was held constitutional
by the Supreme Court of Illinois.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
Bills and Notes</h2>


<p>HISTORY.&mdash;By the term "negotiable paper," we
ordinarily mean promissory notes, bills of exchange
and checks. The law governing negotiable
paper originated among the customs of merchants
on the continent of Europe. It was gradually
introduced into England, and its principles grudgingly
recognized by the common law judges. There
is no branch of law where the desirability of uniformity
is greater, as these documents pass from hand
to hand like money, and travel from one State to another.
Naturally, our first serious attempt at uniform
legislation was made in this branch of law, and
in the year 1896, the Commissioners for Uniform
Laws prepared and recommended for passage the
Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law. To-day, every
State, except Georgia, has passed the Act, as well as
the District of Columbia, Alaska, Porto Rico and
the Philippines. For convenience in this chapter, we
shall hereafter refer to this Negotiable Instruments
Act as the N. I. L.</p>

<p>FORMS OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS.&mdash;It
is essential to carry in mind the customary
form of the negotiable instruments we have
just mentioned. A promissory note is defined by the
N. I. L. as follows: "A negotiable promissory note
within the meaning of this act is an unconditional
promise in writing made by one person to another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
signed by the maker engaging to pay on demand, or
at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain
in money to order or to bearer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>
<h3>SPECIMEN FORM OF PROMISSORY NOTE</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;">
<img src="images/illus377.png" width="467" height="294" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>A bill of exchange is defined by the N. I. L. as follows:
"A bill of exchange is an unconditional order
in writing addressed by one person to another, signed
by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom
it is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable
future time a sum certain in money to order
or to bearer."</p>

<p>A check is defined by N. I. L. as "a bill of exchange
drawn on a bank payable on demand."</p>

<p>Other documents may be negotiable in form, such
as the ordinary bearer corporation bonds, liberty
bonds, certificates of stock, and bills of lading. The
principles discussed in this chapter would apply, ordinarily,
to these documents, and are discussed more
in detail in the chapters devoted to them which we
have already considered.</p>

<p>WHAT IS NEGOTIABILITY?&mdash;Negotiability
has been defined as that quality whereby a bill,
note, or check, passes freely from hand to hand like
currency. In fact, all of these documents are substitutes
for currency, and so far as is practicable, it is
desirable that they should pass as freely as currency.
Negotiability applies only to this branch of the law,
while assignability applies to ordinary cases of contract
law.</p>

</div>

<p>ILLUSTRATIONS.&mdash;To illustrate the difference
between the two: Jones worked for the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio Railroad Co. He presented his bill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
$100 to the proper official, and a check was issued by
the railroad payable to the order of Jones for that
amount. Jones took the check, indorsed it, and with it
paid his grocery bill. The grocery man deposited the
check in his bank, and was notified shortly thereafter
that payment had been stopped on the check by the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio. They claimed a fraud had been
committed, that Jones was overpaid $50, and, therefore,
they refused to honor the check. The grocery
man, having taken this check in the usual course of
business, is what we term a "holder in due course."
The N.I.L. defines a holder in due course as:</p>

<p>Section 52. "A holder in due course is a holder
who has taken the instrument under the following
conditions: (1) That it is complete and regular upon
its face; (2) That he became the holder of it before it
was overdue, and without notice that it had been previously
dishonored, if such was the fact; (3) That he
took it in good faith and for value; (4) That at the
time it was negotiated to him he had no notice of any
infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of
the person negotiating it."</p>

<p>A holder in due course, then, would be entitled to
collect the full $100 from the Baltimore &amp; Ohio. This
check is governed by the law of negotiability with the
result which we have just indicated. Now change the
facts a trifle. Jones presented his bill to the same officer
of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio as before. The officer
says that checks are made out regularly on the first
of the month. It was the fifteenth, and Jones did not
feel able to wait until the first of the next month. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
went to a friend and told him of his claim against
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, and said: "I will assign this
claim to you for $95, and then you can present the
assignment, which I will draw up and sign, to the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio on the first of the month, and get
the $100." His friend agrees and advances the money.
When he presents the written assignment to the
proper officer on the first of the month, he is told that
the railroad has discovered that Jones' claim was
really good for only $50, and that is all they will pay.
Although his assignment reads for $100, he can collect
only $50. This illustration is governed by the
law of assignability, which applies to practically all
contracts, apart from commercial paper. Under the
rules of assignability, a person can assign no better
claim than he has, or, as is sometimes said, the assignee
stands in the shoes of the assignor. Jones
really had a claim of only $50 against the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio, although he claimed it was $100. He could assign
no more than he really had. These two illustrations
show the great difference in the result of the
application of the two principles, negotiability and
assignability.</p>

<p>THE FORMAL REQUIREMENTS OF NEGOTIABLE
PAPER.&mdash;There are certain formalities
which all negotiable paper must have. It must be in
writing, and signed by the proper person. No form
of writing is specified in the Act, and lead pencil, or
even slate pencil, is as good as ink, except that in the
two latter cases the ease with which these forms of
writing may be altered makes them most undesirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
for use. But there is no law requiring the use of ink.</p>

<p>MUST CONTAIN A PROMISE.&mdash;Every negotiable
instrument must contain words of negotiability.
These words are, "to order," "to bearer," "to
holder" or their equivalent. "I promise to pay John
Jones, $100," and signed "John Smith," is a promissory
note, but not a negotiable promissory note, because
it lacks the words to "order" or "bearer," and
is a document which would, therefore, pass by the law
of assignability rather than the law of negotiability.
In taking negotiable paper, therefore, it is always important
to see whether these words are present. If
they are not, the holder will lose the peculiar advantage
and rights which the holder in due course acquires
by the law of negotiability. A promissory note
must contain a promise and a bill of exchange must
contain an unconditional order. An I.O.U. for $100
signed "John Jones" is not a promissory note, because
there is no promise contained in such a document.</p>

<p>UNCONDITIONAL PROMISE.&mdash;All negotiable
documents must be payable without reference to
any contingency. A note reads: "I promise to pay to
the order of John Jones $100 when I attain my twenty-second
birthday" and is signed by John Jones, now
twenty-one. That is not a good note because the person
may not live to be twenty-two. Even if he lives
to become twenty-two the note is still non-negotiable,
for when it was made the contingency existed. A bill
of exchange, regular in form, but adding the expression,
"If the Republicans win the next congressional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
election," is not negotiable. The one exception, as it
might appear at first sight, is a negotiable document
reading: "I promise to pay to the order of William
White six months after death," etc. Such a promise
is not contingent. Death will arrive at some time, although
it may be uncertain just when. In the other
illustrations the republicans might not win the congressional
election, and the person might not become
twenty-two. Again, all commercial paper must be
made payable in money. "I promise to pay to the
order of John Jones $100 worth of tobacco," is not
negotiable. "I promise to pay to the order of John
Jones $100 and fifty pounds of tobacco" is not negotiable.
In both cases, the medium of payment is something
other than money.</p>

<p>INCEPTION OF THE INSTRUMENT AS
AN OBLIGATION.&mdash;In our discussion of contracts,
we made the statement that a legal intention to make
a contract was necessary. The same is true in commercial
paper. A man must intend legally to issue a
negotiable instrument in order to be liable on one as
maker or drawer. Thus, in the case of Walker v. Ebert,
29 Wis. 94, the defendant, a German, unable to read
and write English, was induced by the payee to sign
an instrument, in the form of a promissory note, relying
on the false statement that it was a contract appointing
the defendant agent to sell a patent right.
It was held that the defendant was not liable. The
instrument, though complete in form, was not the
defendant's note and the plaintiff acquired nothing
by his purchase of the paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;We must contrast this
with another situation. Suppose I hand you a paper
with a promissory note printed on it, complete in
every detail except your signature. I ask you to sign
it. You sign the paper, without reading it over or
knowing what it is, and give it back to me. I then
transfer it to a person who takes it for value, in good
faith, etc., or who is, in other words, a holder in due
course. The question is, are you liable on such a
document? The answer is, "Of course, you are."
You may say, "I did not intend to sign a promissory
note." The law answers you by saying, "You were
careless in signing something which you did not read
over, and one is presumed to intend the consequences
of his own careless acts." Our German was in a different
situation. He was not careless. He could not
read English and was obliged to rely upon someone
to tell him what the document was, and, granting
that he used due care in selecting a responsible person
to explain to him the nature of the document, he
had done all the law required. Had he been imposed
upon, on several previous occasions, by the same person
who told him what the document was, and in
spite of that, had relied on him to explain this document,
then, undoubtedly, the court would have held
otherwise and he would have been liable on the
ground that he must have intended the consequences
of his negligent acts, he being deemed negligent
when he trusts a person who had not only misrepresented
things to him but had actually defrauded him
several times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>DELIVERY.&mdash;A note found among the maker's
papers, after his death, imposes no obligation either
upon him or upon his estate. In other words, in addition
to the intentional signing of the document, to
complete its validity, there must also have been what
we call delivery. This is a passing out of the possession
of the maker or drawer, of the document, into
the hands of some third party. Delivery may be made
in three ways: (1) By intention; (2) By fraud; (3) By
negligence.</p>

<p>A VALID DELIVERY NECESSARY.&mdash;I hand
you my promissory note and you take it. That, of
course, is an intentional delivery. You tell me that
you have a fine watch which I decide to buy, and I
give you my promissory note in payment. Afterwards,
upon examining the watch, I find that it is
worthless and entirely different from your description.
You have secured the note from me in that case by
fraud, or there is, as we say, a delivery procured by
fraud. I am sitting on a bench in Central Park, and I
take out of my pocket a completed promissory note
and look at it and place it upon the bench. When I
leave I forget it and it stays there until someone comes
along and picks it up. That is a delivery by negligence.
All these forms of delivery are valid, making
the documents good, some in the hands of all parties,
others in the hands of the holder in due course only.
The N. I. L. is so clear upon this matter that reference
must be made to sections 15 and 16. For this
reason both of these sections are reproduced here in
full:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p>Section 15. "Where an incomplete instrument has
not been delivered it will not, if completed and negotiated,
without authority, be a valid contract in the
hands of any holder, as against any person whose signature
was placed thereon before delivery."</p>

<p>Section 16. "Every contract on a negotiable instrument
is incomplete and revocable until delivery of
the instrument for the purpose of giving effect thereto.
As between immediate parties, and as regards a
remote party other than a holder in due course, the delivery,
in order to be effectual, must be made either by
or under the authority of the party making, drawing,
accepting or indorsing, as the case may be; and in such
case the delivery may be shown to have been conditional,
or for a special purpose only, and not for the
purpose of transferring the property in the instrument.
But where the instrument is in the hands of a
holder in due course, a valid delivery thereof by all
parties prior to him so as to make them liable to him
is conclusively presumed. And where the instrument
is no longer in the possession of a party whose signature
appears thereon, a valid and intentional delivery
by him is presumed until the contrary is proved."</p>

<p>DISTINGUISHING FEATURES.&mdash;It is very
important to distinguish between these two sections.
Let us take for illustration the famous case of Baxendale
v. Bennett, 3 Q.B.Div. 525. Here the defendant
wrote his signature as acceptor on several printed
blank forms of bills of exchange and left them in a
drawer of his desk. The blanks were stolen, filled out,
and negotiated to the plaintiff, an innocent purchaser.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
It was held that the plaintiff could not recover. The
reason for this decision is that the document was incomplete
and as the Act says: "Where an incomplete
instrument has not been delivered it will not, if completed
and negotiated, without authority, be a valid
contract in the hands of any holder, as against any person
whose signature was placed thereon before delivery."
On the other hand, if I leave in my safe,
checks which I have signed and made out in full and
they are payable to bearer, although a thief breaks in
and steals the checks from the safe, those documents
will be valid in the hands of a holder in due course.
The reason here is that although there has been no
delivery, either by intention or by fraud or by negligence,
nevertheless, the Negotiable Instruments Act
has extended this theory of delivery, even further
than the law went before the Act was passed, and says
that when the document is in the hands of a holder
in due course, a delivery is conclusively presumed.</p>

<p>CONSIDERATION.&mdash;Another essential in the
inception of the instrument is consideration. We have
already discussed this topic in the chapter on contracts.
We made the statement at the beginning of
this chapter that the law of negotiable paper came
from the continent of Europe and was grudgingly received
by the courts of England. The law of negotiable
paper on the continent of Europe did not have
any idea of consideration, and this is one reason why
the law was reluctantly admitted to the English common
law and explains the reason now why we have
the doctrine of consideration in negotiable paper. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
would not be safe for the student to accept all we have
said in regard to consideration in the chapter on contracts
and apply it to negotiable paper. The difference
is at once apparent when you read Sections 24
and 28 of the Negotiable Instrument Act which read:</p>

<p>Section 24. "Every negotiable instrument is
deemed prima facie to have been issued for a valuable
consideration; and every person whose signature appears
thereon to have become a party thereto for
value."</p>

<p>Section 28. "Absence or failure of consideration
is a matter of defence as against a person not a holder
in due course."</p>

<p>So, we see, that in the general law of contracts,
consideration is absolutely essential to a binding contract
but in the law of negotiable paper, consideration
is not absolutely essential except when you are dealing
with the immediate parties. An illustration will
explain this. I wish to make you a present on your next
birthday which is January 12. To-day, September 15,
I give you my promissory note due on your birthday
for $50. This is to be my present to you. You take
the note and then hold it until your birthday arrives
and I do not pay it. Then you sue me on the note.
You cannot recover anything because there was no
consideration for the note and the absence of consideration
is a perfectly good defence between you and
me, whom the law calls the immediate parties. But,
suppose, instead of doing this, you had kept the note
about six weeks and then had taken it to your bank
and asked them if they would discount the note for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
you and they had done so, taking it in absolutely good
faith. They know me to be a responsible party, so
they are willing to accept my promissory note. They
knew you and they presumed that you had taken the
note for a valuable consideration although, as a matter
of fact, it was a gift to you. Under the circumstances,
the bank is a holder in due course and when the note
becomes due, if I do not pay, the bank will sue me and
will collect from me because, as the Act says, "the
failure of consideration is a matter of defence as
against any person not a holder in due course." But
the bank is a holder in due course.</p>

<p>ACCEPTANCE OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE.&mdash;The
holder of a bill of exchange will take it, soon
after receiving it, to the drawee, the person upon
whom it is drawn, for his acceptance. The drawee
will accept it by writing across the face of it "Accepted,"
signing his name and perhaps adding "Payable
at the First National Bank." A form of bill of
exchange, duly accepted, will be found elsewhere in
this chapter. The Act provides that the acceptance
must be in writing and signed, either on the document
itself or on a separate piece of paper attached to the
document. As soon as the drawee accepts the bill,
he then becomes known, not as the drawee but as
the acceptor and he is the party primarily liable on the
bill, that is, he assumes responsibility for its payment.
The holder has a right to demand an acceptance for
the full amount of the bill and may refuse to take an
acceptance for a less amount. It is not always possible
for the drawee to know whether he has sufficient funds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
to justify an acceptance, and so the Act gives him
twenty-four hours within which to make up his mind.
During that time the holder is obliged to wait without
taking any further action. Just as a conditional promise
to pay money is not a good promissory note, just
so a conditional acceptance is not looked upon as an
acceptance which a party is obliged to take. There
are, however, occasionally times when a person is willing
to take a conditional acceptance. For example, I
hold a bill of exchange for $1,000. There are three or
four indorsers upon it and I take it to the drawee to
have him accept. He will not accept for more than
$500. Now I feel that the drawer and all of the indorsers
are financially irresponsible and I would rather
have the acceptance of the drawee for $500 than nothing.
I am willing to take it. The question comes up
as to the effect of this upon the other parties, the drawer
and the indorsers. The Act covers that fully and
it is important that it be kept in mind:</p>

<p>Section 142. "The holder may refuse to take a
qualified acceptance, and if he does not obtain an unqualified
acceptance, he may treat the bill as dishonored
by non-acceptance. Where a qualified acceptance
is taken, the drawer and indorsers are discharged
from liability on the bill, unless they have expressly
or impliedly authorized the holder to take a
qualified acceptance, or subsequently assent thereto.
When the drawer or indorser receives notice of a qualified
acceptance, he must, within a reasonable time,
express his dissent to the holder, or he will be deemed
to have assented thereto."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>NEGOTIATION.&mdash;If negotiable paper is a substitute
for money, it follows that its most distinguishing
characteristic is the fact that it may be transferred
from one owner to another. This transfer is made in
one of two ways. It may be by operation of law, or
by act of the parties. By operation of law, we refer to
such a case as where a person dies and his commercial
paper then becomes the property of his administrator
or executor. In other words, the law transfers the
paper to the deceased person's legal representative.
The other case, the transfer by the act of the parties
is, of course, the ordinary case and the one we shall
consider here. The sections in the Negotiable Instruments
Act which discuss this matter are so clear that
we can do no better than insert them in full at this
time:</p>

<p>Section 30. "An instrument is negotiated when
it is transferred from one person to another in such a
manner as to constitute the transferee the holder
thereof. If payable to bearer it is negotiated by delivery;
if payable to order it is negotiated by the indorsement
of the holder completed by delivery."</p>

<p>Section 31. "The indorsement must be written on
the instrument itself or upon a paper attached thereto.
The signature of the indorser, without additional
words, is a sufficient indorsement."</p>

<p>Section 32. "The indorsement must be an indorsement
of the entire instrument. An indorsement
which purports to transfer to the indorsee a part only
of the amount payable, or which purports to transfer
the instrument to two or more indorsees severally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
does not operate as a negotiation of the instrument.
But where the instrument has been paid in part, it
may be indorsed as to the residue."</p>

<p>NEGOTIATION BY INDORSEMENT.&mdash;Reference
should be made to the several kinds of negotiation
by indorsement. We have first the blank indorsement.
There the person to whom the document is
payable simply writes his name on the back in the
same way as it appears on the front. That is, if John
Jones is the payee, he writes his name across the back
of the instrument "JOHN JONES." Next, there is
the special indorsement. John Jones, in this case, is
the payee and wishes to transfer the note to John
Wanamaker. He writes across the back, "pay to the
order of John Wanamaker" and signs his name,
JOHN JONES. A restrictive indorsement is one
where the further negotiation of the instrument is
limited or restricted altogether. For example, the
payee writes across the back "Pay to the order of
John Jones only." That restricts the further negotiation
of the instrument. Another form that is commonly
used is in depositing checks in the bank in your
own account; usually you indorse "for collection" and
sign your name, or you indorse "for deposit only" and
sign your name. This form of indorsement simply
constitutes the bank your agent to make collection,
but not for any other purpose except that the Act now
authorizes a bank to begin suit to collect on a document
indorsed in that way. Another form of indorsement,
known as the qualified indorsement, is frequently
used in the case where you wish to indorse without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
incurring the usual liability of the indorser. This is
done by adding under your name the expression "without
recourse." This does not mean, as is commonly
supposed, that you are free from all liability as an indorser.
We shall refer to this later.</p>

<p>THE HOLDER IN DUE COURSE.&mdash;As we
have seen, the distinguishing feature of the law of
commercial paper is negotiability as distinguished
from assignability. The principles of negotiability are
designed very largely for the protection of the person
whom we call the holder in due course. It is essential
then to bear in mind the condition under which a person
becomes such. Section 52 of the Act defines a
holder in due course as follows:</p>

<p>Section 52. "A holder in due course is a holder
who has taken the instrument under the following
conditions: (1) That the instrument is complete and
regular upon its face; (2) That he became the holder
of it before it was overdue, and without notice that it
had been previously dishonored, if such was the fact;
(3) That he took it in good faith and for value; (4)
That at the time it was negotiated to him he had no
notice of any infirmity in the instrument or defect in
the title of the person negotiating it." Section 57 defines
what the rights of this holder in due course are:</p>

<p>Section 57. "A holder in due course holds the instrument
free from any defect of title of prior parties,
and free from defences available to prior parties
among themselves, and may enforce payment of the
instrument for the full amount thereof against all parties
liable thereon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>It is clear, then, that by this section, the Act
means that the holder in due course takes free of personal
defences, although he does not take free of absolute
defences. It simply remains for us to consider
briefly what is meant by a personal defence and what
is meant by an absolute defence. We have already illustrated
this in one of our cases where the note was
a present. In this case, there was no consideration
for the note. The boy to whom it was given could not
recover, whereas when he transferred it to an innocent
third party, a holder for value, he could recover. Thus
we say, failure of consideration is a personal defence.
Again, some person steals my check book, fills out a
check, and forges my name. The check is then taken
and finally gets into the hands of a person who is
strictly a holder in due course. He could not recover
on it, however, because forgery is a real defence. That
is, no one can hold me liable on my forged check. The
ordinary illustration of real or absolute defences are
infancy, lunacy, illegality and sometimes fraud. Other
defences are generally personal defences and do not
affect the holder in due course. To put it another way,
a real defence is good against the whole world; a personal
defence is available only against such as are not
holders in due course.</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF PARTIES.&mdash;The parties primarily
liable on negotiable documents are, on a note,
the maker; on a bill of exchange, the acceptor; and
on a check, the drawer. The liability of these three
parties is most concisely stated in Sections 60, 61, 62,
as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>Section 60. "The maker of a negotiable instrument
by making it engages that he will pay it according
to its tenor, and admits the existence of the payee
and his then capacity to indorse."</p>

<p>Section 61. "The drawer by drawing the instrument
admits the existence of the payee, and his
then capacity to indorse; and engages that on due
presentment the instrument will be accepted or paid,
or both, according to its tenor, and that if it be dishonored
and the necessary proceedings on dishonor
be duly taken, he will pay the amount thereof to the
holder, or to any subsequent indorser who may be
compelled to pay it. But the drawer may insert in the
instrument an express stipulation negativing or limiting
his own liability to the holder."</p>

<p>Section 62. "The acceptor by accepting the instrument
engages that he will pay it according to the
tenor of his acceptance; and admits: (1) The existence
of the drawer, the genuineness of his signature, and
his capacity and authority to draw the instrument;
and, (2) The existence of the payee and his then capacity
to indorse."</p>

<p>INDORSERS' LIABILITY.&mdash;We have not yet
considered the question of the liability of persons who
transfer negotiable documents. Indorsements may
be made, as we have said, in two ways: either by indorsing
the document, or if it is payable to bearer, by
delivering it without indorsement. The liability of
these two parties is stated in the Negotiable Instruments
Act in Sections 65 and 66 in the following
language:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>Section 65. "Every person negotiating an instrument
by delivery or by a qualified indorsement, warrants:
(1) That the instrument is genuine and in all
respects what it purports to be; (2) That he has a
good title to it; (3) That all prior parties had capacity
to contract; (4) That he has no knowledge of any fact
which would impair the validity of the instrument or
render it valueless. But when the negotiation is by
delivery only, the warranty extends in favor of no
holder other than the immediate transferee. The provisions
of subdivision three of this section do not apply
to persons negotiating public or corporation securities
other than bills and notes."</p>

<p>Section 66. "Every indorser who indorses without
qualification, warrants to all subsequent holders
in due course: (1) The matters and things mentioned
in subdivision one, two and three of the next preceding
section; and (2) That the instrument is at the
time of his indorsement valid and subsisting. And,
in addition, he engages that on due presentment, it
shall be accepted or paid, or both, as the case may be,
according to its tenor, and that if it be dishonored, and
the necessary proceedings on dishonor be duly taken,
he will pay the amount thereof to the holder, or to any
subsequent indorser who may be compelled to pay it."</p>

<p>QUALIFIED INDORSEMENT.&mdash;Section 65
speaks of delivery by qualified instrument. You will
remember that we have already mentioned the indorsement
in the form "without recourse." This is a
qualified indorsement. The kind of liability a person
incurs who indorses in that way is set forth in Section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
65. This is important because the layman assumes
that in indorsing "without recourse" one means
to incur no liability as indorser. Such is not the case.
Reread section 65, which covers the indorsement
without recourse. There is liability for the things
mentioned therein. Then in section 66, the last paragraph,
you will notice that every indorser, who indorses
without qualification "engages that on due
presentment, it shall be accepted or paid, or both, as
the case may be, according to its tenor, and that if it be
dishonored, and the necessary proceedings on dishonor
be duly taken, he will pay the amount thereof
to the holder." This does not mean that the indorser
will always pay, but only if the necessary steps are
taken. We shall consider what these necessary steps
are when we take up the subject of "protest."</p>

<p>CHECKS.&mdash;A check is simply a bill of exchange
drawn on a bank and payable on demand. Therefore,
the general principles which we have been laying
down, in regard to bills of exchange and other negotiable
paper, apply to checks, although, of course, the
check is a more recent development in the law of
commercial paper than the other two forms, namely,
the promissory note and the bill of exchange. Section
186 of the Act reads: "A check must be presented for
payment within a reasonable time after its issue or
the drawer will be discharged from liability thereon
to the extent of the loss caused by the delay."</p>

<p>HOLDER OF CHECK.&mdash;It is important to remember
that the holder of a check has no right against
the bank. Thus, if I hold John Rockefeller's check,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
drawn on the Institute National Bank, and I present
it to the bank and the bank refuses to pay it for no
reason at all, or for a purely arbitrary reason, I cannot
sue the bank. The only thing I can do is to seek
to get the money on the check from Mr. Rockefeller
personally. This is because the drawing of a check is
not the assignment of so much money to the payee
named in the check. Of course, Mr. Rockefeller
might sue his bank for failure to honor his check if
it refuses to pay it to me for no valid reason. One further
fact is important. When a holder of a check
procures it to be certified by the bank, that releases all
indorsers and also the drawer. And so, if I have a
check drawn by Mr. Rockefeller and indorsed by six
millionaires and I take that to the bank and have them
certify it and then the bank fails, I have lost everything
if the bank never pays anything to a depositor.
By getting it certified I release Mr. Rockefeller and
all of the indorsers.</p>

<p>THE MEANING OF PROTEST.&mdash;Protest is
often used broadly to signify any dishonor of a negotiable
instrument, but, of course, properly it means
presentment by a notary, and his certification that an
instrument has been presented for payment and has
been dishonored. Protest is only necessary in regard
to foreign bills. A foreign bill is one which is drawn
in one State and payable in another. For this purpose
the different States of the Union are foreign to each
other. A bill drawn in New York payable in Boston
is as much a foreign bill for this purpose as one drawn
in England payable here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>WHAT MAY BE PROTESTED.&mdash;Though protest
is not necessary for any other negotiable instrument
except foreign bills of exchange, including foreign
checks, it is convenient frequently to protest
other negotiable instruments. The law provides that
protest may be made of other negotiable instruments,
and the certificate of protest is evidence in such cases,
as well as in the case of foreign bills of exchange, of
the facts which it states, namely, that the instrument
has been duly presented and notice given. Statements
in a certificate of protest, however, whether of foreign
bills or of other instruments, are not conclusive evidence
of the facts which they state. They are some
evidence, but it may be shown by other evidence that
the instrument was not presented, or was not presented
at the time the certificate asserts, or that the
notice was not given as therein asserted.</p>

<p>SUGGESTIONS FOR DRAWING NEGOTIABLE
PAPER.&mdash;Very few suggestions are necessary
in drawing checks. We almost always use the printed
form. The only thing to be careful about is to draw
lines through the blank spaces so that a check written
for $70 may not have something else written before
the word seventy, thereby raising the amount
to, say, One thousand seventy, and the figures,
because they are not near the dollar sign, correspondingly
raised. The promissory note is frequently
drawn by the parties without any printed form. In
order to be negotiable, the note must bear the words
"or order," or "bearer"; otherwise, it would not be
negotiable, and would pass by the law of assignability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
without any of the advantages accruing to negotiable
paper. The draft, or bill of exchange, is the document
which the average layman is the least familiar
with, and before drawing one, a printed form should
be secured or a book on negotiable paper be consulted.</p>

<p>NEGOTIABILITY.&mdash;Care should be taken in
the indorsement of any negotiable paper. The indorsement
in blank, that is, simply writing your name
upon the paper on the back, is the one commonly
used, but is a dangerous one to use, if there is any
possibility of the paper being lost or stolen. For example,
A has a promissory note payable to his order,
and he simply writes his name across the back and
mails it to a person who has agreed to accept it in
payment of a bill A owes him. The letter is lost, gets
into the hands of X, who opens it and takes the note.
Of course, the note is no good to X. X, however,
takes the note to someone and persuades that person
to discount the note for him. That person does it in
good faith, believing X came by the note rightfully.
The discounter is therefore a holder in due course, and
he would be able to collect on the note. What A
should have done, when he sent the note to his friend
John Brown, was to have indorsed it specially, "Pay
to the order of John Brown, A." Again, a person who
is collecting some money for his friend receives a
check payable to his order. He wants to turn the
check over to his friend, and indorses it by a special
indorsement. When the friend tries to collect on the
check, it is returned "no funds." The friend now may
hold the person responsible who indorsed the check,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
because an indorser guarantees the payment of the
instrument if the proper steps be taken to fix his liability.
Ordinarily, of course, we wish an indorser to
assume this liability, but in this particular case there
was no reason why this man should have indorsed the
check in that way. He could have indorsed it, and
added to his signature the words "without recourse,"
which would have relieved him from paying the instrument
if the drawer did not pay it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
Torts and Crimes</h2>


<p>TORT, CONTRACT, AND CRIME DISTINGUISHED.&mdash;We
have already discussed contracts
in detail. The fundamental idea of contracts
is that the obligation of a contract is voluntarily
assumed. Although it might be difficult, at least
theoretically, I may take the position that I will not
enter into any contractual relationship with anyone
for a month. I could do this legally, if I were willing
to put up with the annoyance which I would probably
suffer. But suppose I take the position that I will assault
Jones and I will not pay him any damages for
the injuries occasioned by my assault. My position
would be wholly untenable. The contract obligation
is voluntarily assumed. The law imposes the obligations
or duties which exist in torts, and I must observe
those duties whether I wish to or not. Similarly,
one must observe all of the criminal law of the jurisdiction
where he is, whether he will or not. In fact, ignorance
of the law is no excuse. A man may even
commit a crime, although he did not know there was a
law prohibiting the act. Again, in the definition of a
tort, we shall find the expression, "breach of duty imposed
by law." A man arrives home late at night. He
finds a person suffering from exposure at his front
door. The person asks to be taken in and lodged for
the night, but the householder refuses to take him in,
and the man contracts pneumonia from exposure. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
this case the householder is not liable. There is no
duty imposed by law to be your brother's keeper.
There may be a moral obligation in the case just cited,
but not a legal one.</p>

<p>JURISDICTION.&mdash;There is another way in
which a criminal action is sometimes different from an
action in contract or an action in tort. A suit on a
contract may be brought in any court where jurisdiction
over the parties may be secured. For example,
A and B make a contract in New York. The contract
is broken, and six months later, A and B are both in
Galveston, Texas. Either party could sue the other
in the Texas court on the broken contract. The same
is true in regard to most tort actions. A slanders B
in New York. A little later both are in San Francisco,
California. B could sue A in a California court
for slander. A criminal prosecution, however, must
always be brought in the State where the crime is
committed, and generally in that very county of the
State. Hence, if A murders B in Kings County, New
York, the trial could not, under any circumstances, be
held in Essex County, New Jersey, for no New Jersey
court would have jurisdiction over an offense committed
in New York, because the wrong is done to the
people of the State of New York, and not to the people
of the State of New Jersey.</p>

<p>TORT DEFINED.&mdash;It has been stated by the
Court of Appeals of New York that no satisfactory
definition of a tort can be found. It is easier, perhaps,
to explain to the layman the meaning of the term
"tort" by simply enumerating such things as are torts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
For example, assault and battery is a tort, and so are
libel, slander, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution,
fraud, deceit, and negligence. Bigelow's definition
is perhaps least objectionable of all of the definitions.
He defines a tort as a breach of duty imposed
by municipal law, for which a suit of damages will lie.
Every tort involves the violation of a duty owed to the
individual. For example, A owes to B the duty not
to attempt with force to harm his person, or to hit
him, or to touch him intentionally, or recklessly. The
violation of this duty to B, by A, constitutes the tort
of assault and battery. Again, A owes to B the duty
not to injure B's reputation, either by spoken word or
by written word, so long as B has done nothing to forfeit
this right to a good reputation. The violation of
this duty, on the part of A, constitutes the tort of libel
or slander. So, then, it is easy to see why libel, for
example, is a tort. It is a breach of duty which the law
imposes upon A for which B may sue and recover
damages if he is injured. The same with assault and
battery, and the various other torts.</p>

<p>CRIME DEFINED.&mdash;A tort, as we have indicated,
is a breach of duty owed by A to B. A crime is
also a breach of duty, but in this case, A is an individual
citizen, and B is a sovereign State. C murders D.
When C is prosecuted, the action will read, "The people
of the State of New York against C." In other
words, the crime is a wrong to the State, and so a
crime has been defined as an act or omission which is
forbidden by law, to which a punishment is annexed,
and which a State prosecutes in its own name. Murder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
manslaughter, arson and forgery are all crimes.
We may correctly also add assault and battery, thus
suggesting the fact that the same act may be both a
crime and a tort, because the assault is a wrong
against the individual and against the State. The individual
will sue in a civil court, to recover pecuniary
damages, in an ordinary suit of tort, while the State,
for the same offense, through the district attorney's or
prosecutor's office, will criminally proceed against the
guilty party. We shall now consider briefly some of
the more important torts and crimes.</p>

<p>ASSAULT AND BATTERY.&mdash;Assault is an attempt,
real or apparent, to do injury to the person of
another. Battery is a completed assault. It is not
necessary that a person have the actual ability to
carry out the threat to constitute an assault. For example,
to point an unloaded revolver at a person is an
assault. While the definition might convey the impression
that force was necessary, this is not strictly
true, because deception sometimes may be the equivalent
of force. For example: Assault and battery is
committed where a person administers a drug to someone
under the belief that he is taking an entirely different
kind of drug. Certain assaults, although technically
such, are excusable or justifiable. Formerly a
school teacher had the right of corporal punishment
without being liable for assault and battery. By
statute this right is generally taken away now. A
parent, however, may inflict corporal punishment on
his child without any civil liability. Courts generally
assign as the reason for this, the fact that it would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
be conducive to the welfare of the family to have children
sue their parents, and the further fact that the
child's rights are protected by giving him the right to
have his parent arrested and punished criminally for
an assault. While it was held formerly that a husband
had the right to beat his wife, no modern court has upheld
this view.</p>

<p>SELF-DEFENSE.&mdash;Another case where assault
is justified is in the case of self-defense. It is common
saying that a man's house is his castle, and the right
of self-defense is founded on the right of self-preservation.
So that it follows that a man may use force in
protecting both himself and his property. A greater
amount of force is ordinarily permitted in the protection
of the person than of property. In using force,
however, such force only as is reasonably necessary
may be used. For example, a man attempts to take
my watch from my pocket. I strike his arm to prevent
it, and do so successfully. Thereafter, as soon
as the man's back is turned, I jump on him and assault
him, injuring him severely. I would be liable in this
case because more force than is necessary for the protection
of my property was used.</p>

<p>LIBEL AND SLANDER.&mdash;These two terms are
frequently combined under the one term of defamation
which is defined as a false imputation upon one's
character or reputation. Slander is oral defamation,
and libel is written defamation. The action of slander
is very technical. Perhaps there is no better summary
than that given by the United States Supreme Court
in the case of Pollard v. Lyon, 91 U. S. 225, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
what statements are slanderous per se. "Slander,"
the court says, "may be divided into five classes, as follows:
(1) Words falsely spoken of a person which impute
to the party the commission of some criminal offense
involving moral turpitude, for which the party, if
the charge is true, may be indicted and punished.
(2) Words falsely spoken of a person which impute
that the party is infected with some contagious disease,
where, if the charge is true, it would exclude the
party from society; or (3) Defamatory words falsely
spoken of a person, which impute to the party unfitness
to perform the duties of an office or employment
of profit, or the want of integrity in the discharge of
the duties of such an office or employment. (4) Defamatory
words falsely spoken of a party which prejudice
such party in his or her profession or trade.
(5) Defamatory words falsely spoken of a person,
which, though not in themselves actionable, occasion
the party special damage." A libel is any writing, picture,
print or effigy which tends to hold one up to the
contempt, scorn, ridicule, or disgrace of his fellow
men. We see then, that many statements which would
not be slanderous would be libelous.</p>

<p>PRINCIPLES COMMON TO BOTH LIBEL
AND SLANDER.&mdash;Certain principles are common
to both libel and slander. There must be a publication
in either case. To say to a school teacher, in a
room where he and the speaker are the only persons
present, that he is a fool, would not be slanderous.
There is no publication. To write a letter to a minister
calling him a thief and a crook would not be libelous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
because there would be no publication. After he
had opened the letter and read it, should he show it
to any of his friends, he would have made the publication,
and impliedly have consented to its publication.
Whether to send statements like this on a postal card
constitutes a publication or a libel is an open question,
as also is the question whether the dictation of false
statements to a person's stenographer constitutes publication
to some third person.</p>

<p>PRIVILEGE.&mdash;Certain clearly slanderous or
libelous statements may, nevertheless, not be actionable,
because they are absolutely or qualifiedly privileged.
Such is the case of any speech made by a member
of Congress, or a member of the State Legislature
on the floor of the legislative hall. Such statement,
however, made from the stump during a political campaign,
would not be privileged. The first is what we call
an absolute privilege. There is a certain class of privilege
which we speak of as qualified privilege. Newspapers,
for example, are permitted to comment by way
of criticism on any matters of current interest, provided
a reasonable limit is not exceeded. It would not
be permissible for a newspaper to pick out John Jones,
a wholly retiring and inconspicuous citizen of a town,
and make statements about him which hold him up to
ridicule, because the public welfare does not call for
such action. However, were John Jones running for
public office, it would be proper for a newspaper to
make comment upon his record, and such statements
would have a qualified privilege, although subjecting
him to ridicule. A member of the legislature on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
floor of the legislature could make statements concerning
the same John Jones and never be liable because
of his absolute privilege. We must assume,
that, with each case mentioned, the statement made is
false, in order to have it constitute libel or slander. In
other words, truth is a defense to an action for defamation.
A person has no right to a false character,
and to speak the truth about him does not, therefore,
constitute a tort.</p>

<p>FRAUD OR DECEIT.&mdash;In order to establish
the tort of fraud, it is necessary to prove the following
five allegations: (1) that A makes a false statement of
a material fact; (2) with knowledge of its falsity; (3)
with the intent that it should be acted upon; (4) that
the other party believed it to be true; and, (5) acted
upon it to his damage. The absence of any one of
these five elements will prevent the action of fraud
from existing. The action of fraud is most important
not only in torts, but also it plays a large part in the
law of contracts, and the law of sales, as to both real
property and personal property. A stock broker says
to Mr. Jones: "My house is offering the best bargain
in oil stocks which has been on the market for five
years. Aetna Oil Mining Stock at $5 a share is the
best buy on the curb to-day. There is no doubt the
company will pay 10% in dividends in the first year."
Green, relying on this representation, purchases 100
shares of the stock. The stock, thereafter, steadily
declines, and never pays a dividend. Has he cause of
action for fraud? Clearly not, because there has been
no false statement of material fact. These statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
about the future earning capacity are seller's talk, or
the salesman is merely puffing his wares. Both these
expressions are common in the reports and for a mere
statement of opinion, no action of fraud lies. It must
be a statement of fact. Supposing the same broker
had said to his customer, "Aetna Oil Company has
paid 10% dividends for the last ten years," and such
statement afterwards was found by the purchaser to
have been false. An action of fraud would lie, because
the dividend record of a company is in the past, and it
is not opinion, but fact. Again, suppose the statements
to have been the same as in the second illustration,
and that they were altogether false, but within
three months, through a sudden change in conditions,
the affairs of the company were greatly improved, the
stock went up in value, and began to pay large dividends.
Again, there would be no cause of action, because
the fifth element, that of damage, would be lacking.
Again, suppose the purchaser, after learning
from the broker about the past dividend record, should
say, "I will give you my answer to-morrow." Meanwhile,
he looks up in a financial paper the dividend
record and discovers the statements to be false. He
then purchases the stock. Here he would have no
cause of action, although he might be damaged, for
the reason that by making his own investigation, he
has clearly shown that he has not relied on the statement
made by the broker, and the fourth element of
the action of fraud is missing. In all of these situations,
the court assumes that it is dealing with a person
of ordinary intelligence, and it does not require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
the very highest degree of caution on the part of the
person claiming to be defrauded, nor will it aid the defrauded
person if he does not exercise an ordinary degree
of care in safeguarding his rights and forming his
judgment in the particular transaction. In laying
down this rule, the court does not require that a person
must make his own private investigation ordinarily,
but he may rely upon the statement made to him. For
example, in a Massachusetts case, a real estate broker,
in selling a piece of property to a purchaser in a suburban
town adjoining Boston, told him that forty trains
per day stopped there. The statement was false, the
purchaser could have easily inquired at the railroad
ticket office, which was only a short distance from the
real estate agent's office, but he did not do so. It was
held that he could recover in an action of fraud. Were
it not so, the courts would, in practice, be laying down
the rule that one must assume everyone a liar. On the
other hand, had this same purchaser been defrauded
by the same real estate dealer a half-dozen times before,
then he would not be acting as a reasonably careful
man in relying on a statement of this kind. Under
these circumstances, the ordinary prudent man would
make his own investigation.</p>

<p>FALSE IMPRISONMENT.&mdash;A person under
ordinary conditions, enjoys the full right of freedom
of locomotion. The invasion of that right we call
false imprisonment. It is immaterial how trivial the
imprisonment may be, for merely locking a person in
a room for five minutes as a joke would be enough to
give rise to cause for action. The amount of damages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
which the jury might allow under the circumstances
would, of course, be another matter. Many of the
principles mentioned in assault and battery are applicable
in this tort. Certain persons have a right to
imprison other people, and it is not false imprisonment.
The sheriff of the county, with a warrant for
my arrest, may imprison me, and, of course, I have no
action for false imprisonment. He is acting under
regular process from the court. A man commits a serious
crime in my presence. I lock him in a room
until I can call an officer. This is not false imprisonment.
The right of a private citizen to make an arrest
and not be liable for false imprisonment is stated as
follows in Section 183, of the New York Code of Criminal
Procedure:</p>

<p>A private person may arrest another: (1) For a
crime, committed or attempted in his presence; (2)
When the person arrested has committed a felony,
although not in his presence.</p>

<p>This is typical of the rule as it exists, with slight
modifications, in most of the States. While mere
words alone will not constitute an assault, it has been
held that mere words will constitute false imprisonment.
While a person may be justified in arresting
someone else, yet, for the abuse of that privilege, the
same as using greater force in self-defense than is necessary,
the action of false imprisonment will lie. The
man whom I arrest for committing a very serious
crime in my presence, I lock in my house and keep
there a month, feeding him on bread and water. I am
guilty of false imprisonment because while I had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
right to arrest him, it was my duty to turn him over
to the proper authorities just as soon as possible. In
a case, such as this, a month is, of course, an unreasonable
time.</p>

<p>NEGLIGENCE.&mdash;To say that negligence is failure
to use due care is a poor attempt at definition, but
it is practically all that can be said. The common law
maxim, "sic utere tuo ut alium non laedas" (so use
your own as not to injure another), is at this basis
of the law of negligence. At the outset, we must be
careful to distinguish between "accident" and "negligence."
I am walking on a street and slip on a banana
skin, and in falling, knock down a passing pedestrian.
This is an accident. With my office window overlooking
the street, in a banana-eating contest, I eat fifteen
bananas, and throw the skins out of the window on
the sidewalk. The street is not well lighted. A
passerby falls and is injured. This is negligence, and
I would be liable.</p>

<p>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE.&mdash;Negligence
must be proved in order to entitle the injured
party to recover. The court will not presume negligence
merely because an injury takes place. Again,
I repeatedly warn a motorman and conductor on a
trolley car that I wish to get off at a certain station.
Both parties forget the request, and the car goes by
the station at the rate of fifteen miles an hour. I
think I can get off safely, and attempt to do so. In
doing so, I slip and break a leg. Although the two
employees of the trolley company were negligent, for
not attending to their business, I am guilty of contributory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
negligence in trying to get off a rapidly
moving car, and cannot recover. Contributory negligence
is a bar to recovery.</p>

<p>STANDARD OF CARE.&mdash;The standards of care
to be applied in negligence vary from time to time.
What would have been due care on the part of a railroad
company fifty years ago, would probably, in few
cases, be held to be due care to-day. This is so, because
of the improvements which have been made in
mechanical devices in the past fifty years. Again, in
order to make a cause of action for negligence, there
must be some causal relation between the negligent
act and the injury. Granting that the man who
slipped on the banana skin, which I threw from my
office window, had sued me for damages because of
his broken leg, it would not follow that I would be
liable to the same man five years later, for the reason
that an insurance company denied him a policy because
of stiffness in the same broken leg, caused by
the fall on the banana skin. The law looks not at the
remote, but at the proximate, cause of the injury.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;The owner of lands owes a
duty to persons coming upon that land, and the failure
to perform that duty is negligence. Here, again,
we have to consider who the person is. I enter Wanamaker's
store to make a purchase. In going from
the second to the third floor, I trip on a defective
nosing on the stairway. This has been out of order
for some time, and the floor walker was aware of
that fact. I have a cause of action against Wanamaker's
store for failure, on their part, to exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
due care in having the premises reasonably safe for
the use of customers. Suppose, in making a purchase
in that same store, in the basement, I see an open door
leading into the engine room where the heat generator
is located. Being interested in heating appliances,
I go into the room, although there is a sign above the
door "no admittance." I fall in an unguarded hole
in the floor, which has been open for a long while, and
the existence of this hole is known to the management.
I cannot recover because I am a trespasser. I
am in a place where I had no right to be, and, as to
trespassers, the owner of property owes no duty, except
to refrain from wilful attempts to injure such a
person. I may not set a trap in my back yard to catch
a trespasser, although I owe no duty to him to have
the back yard safe for his use. A peculiar variation
in this rule has been made by some States, in the so-called
turn-tables cases. Railroads maintain turn-tables
in their yards for the purpose of reversing locomotives
and other cars. While children, coming upon
the premises, are trespassers, nevertheless, many
courts have held that such things are what might be
called "attractive nuisances," and in such cases the
owner of property is under special duty to use care
even as to trespassers, to see that they are not injured.
These are merely a few of the general principles
of the law of negligence as applied by the
courts.</p>

<p>CAPACITY OF PARTIES IN TORT ACTIONS.&mdash;We
discussed the question of the capacity
of parties in making a contract. There is not as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
qualification upon a party's liability for tort as for
contract. To-day, generally, a married woman is liable
for her torts, the same as any one else. A corporation is
liable for its torts committed by its agents or servants
in the scope of their employment. An infant is held
responsible for his torts. It is sometimes said that a
person is liable for his torts from the cradle to the
grave. This is not strictly true. If a baby two years
old puts his finger in my eye, injuring it, he would
clearly not be liable. But a person of tender years is
liable for his torts, whenever he has sufficient intelligence
to know what he is doing. Some courts place
the age at seven years, while others consider each individual
case and the degree of intelligence possessed
by the infant.</p>

<p>THE CRIMINAL LAW.&mdash;A crime is a wrong
which the State recognizes as injurious to the public
welfare, and punishes in a criminal action in its own
name. There are certain leading principles of the
American system of criminal law which must be kept
in mind.</p>

<p>(1) A man is presumed to be innocent until the
contrary is shown, and a jury, to be justified in bringing
in a verdict of guilty, must be satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused. The rule
in civil cases is that the jury must find for the plaintiff
or defendant by a preponderance of evidence. Thus,
it is possible for a person to secure a verdict in a civil
action for damages for assault and battery, while with
the same evidence, a jury would not be justified, in a
criminal action in convicting the defendant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) In general, no person may be tried for a
criminal offense, of any magnitude, until he has been
indicted by a grand jury. The grand jury is generally
twenty-four men, and hears the case against the prisoner
only as presented by the prosecutor or district
attorney. If the grand jury believes the evidence to
be sufficient to warrant a trial before the petit jury,
they bring in a true bill, and then the trial takes place
before the petit jury of twelve men, in open court.
The prisoner is entitled to counsel, at the State's expense,
if he is not able to furnish his own.</p>

<p>(3) The prisoner may not twice be put in
jeopardy for the same offense.</p>

<p>(4) A person may not be tried under an "ex
post facto" law.</p>

<p>An "ex post facto" law is one which makes an
act, which was innocent when committed, a crime.
Such laws are unconstitutional. This term is never
used in civil law, but the term "retroactive statute"
expresses the same idea. Thus, a statute passed January
15, 1920, providing that all contracts made since
January 1, 1919, must be witnessed by three witnesses,
would be a "retroactive statute" and not valid.</p>

<p>CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY.&mdash;As a general
rule, if a person, when a crime is committed, has
sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature of
the particular act constituting the crime, and the
mental capacity to know whether it is right or wrong,
he is liable criminally, whatever may be his capacity
in other respects. As in contracts, or torts, there is
a special rule in regard to infants. The English common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
law, which is pretty generally followed in this
country, is that a child under the age of seven is conclusively
presumed incapable of committing a crime.
This is because of the fact that at common law, a
criminal intent was necessary in all crimes, and an
infant under seven was presumed not sufficiently advanced
to be able to form a criminal intent. Between
the ages of seven and fourteen, there is a presumption
of incapacity to commit a crime, the presumption being
very strong near seven, and rather weak near
fourteen. Between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one,
the presumption is that the infant is capable of
committing a crime. As a general rule, one person
is not liable for the crimes of another, unless he participated
in them, directly or indirectly. A partner,
therefore, is not liable, criminally, for the acts of his
partners, merely because they are his partners.
Neither is a principal or master liable for the criminal
acts of his agent or servant, merely because the relationship
is that of principal and agent or master and
servant. We will consider briefly a few of the more
important crimes.</p>

<p>HOMICIDE.&mdash;Homicide is the killing of a human
being, and is divided into excusable, felonious,
and justifiable homicide. The distinction between
excusable and justifiable homicide is very slight and
perhaps of little utility. Where either exists, a homicide
takes place under such circumstances that the
party cannot strictly be said to have committed the
act wilfully and intentionally, or if he does commit it
with full intention, under such circumstances of duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
as to render the act performed not a felonious homicide.
A felonious homicide is committed wilfully and
under such circumstances as to render it punishable.
Murder is the wilful killing of any person with malice
aforethought. In some States, by legislative enactments,
murder is divided into degrees, as murder in
the first degree and murder in the second degree. The
penalty for murder in the first degree is death, or in a
State where capital punishment is abolished, life imprisonment.
There are various other distinctions between
these two forms of murder which must be ascertained
from the statutes themselves.</p>

<p>MANSLAUGHTER.&mdash;Manslaughter is the unlawful
killing of another without malice, either express
or implied. Manslaughter is also frequently
divided into different degrees, and the punishment
varies accordingly. A reference to the State statutes
is necessary, as in murder, to know what the local
law is.</p>

<p>BURGLARY.&mdash;Burglary, as a common law offense,
is the breaking and entering of a dwelling house
of another, in the night time, with the intent to commit
a felony therein, whether the felony be actually
committed or not. But in most jurisdictions the offense
has been extended by statute so as to include
breaking and entries which were not burglary at common
law. Unless changed by statute, it must be
committed in the night time, and there must be both
a breaking and an entering. Breaking a window,
taking a pane of glass out, or bending the nails, is a
breaking. Cutting a wire netting on a screen door is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
also a breaking. In such cases a screen door is not
to be considered as a mere protection against flies
and mosquitoes, but as a part of the building. As to
whether opening a door or a window, already partly
open, constitutes a breaking, the cases are in conflict.
Without the intent to commit a felony, breaking and
entering is a bare trespass, which would not be a
crime. The felonious intent must exist at the time
of the breaking and entering. Hence, if it can be
proved satisfactorily to a jury, that a man broke into
a house for a night's lodging only, he would not be
guilty of burglary. As in homicide, reference must
be made to the local statutes for the actual definition
of burglary and its punishment in that jurisdiction.</p>

<p>FORGERY.&mdash;Forgery is the false making of an
alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another
man's right. Forgery may be committed of any writing,
which, if changed, would operate as the foundation
of another man's liability. Hence a check may
be forged, an assignment of a legal claim, an indorsement
on any negotiable document, an acceptance of
a bill of exchange, a letter of recommendation, a railroad
pass or railroad ticket. The penalty for forgery
and various other acts of which it may consist, are so
purely statutory as to make any further comment
useless.</p>

<p>LARCENY.&mdash;Larceny is the felonious taking of
the property of another, without his consent and
against his will, with the intent to convert it to the
use of the taker. The taking must be with criminal
intent, but not necessarily for the sake of gain, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
the property must be of some value, however
slight. The taking must be against the consent of
the owner, and if the consent is given, although obtained
by fraud, the crime is not larceny. Larceny
relates only to personal property. Hence the statement
made falsely concerning A: "you are a thief.
You stole my marle" (marle being a kind of earth),
is not slander, because it is not a charge of a crime
involving moral turpitude, as real property is not the
subject of larceny. Larceny is generally divided into
petty larceny and grand larceny, the difference between
the two being generally the amount involved,
which varies with the local legislation.</p>

<p>ROBBERY.&mdash;Robbery, at common law, is the
taking, with intent to steal, of personal property in
possession of another, from his person or in his presence,
by violence or by putting him in fear. In a
majority of jurisdictions, statutes have been enacted
defining robbery substantially in accord with the common
law. It is not necessary that the property taken
should be the property of the person from whom it
is taken. As in other crimes, there must be a criminal
intent, and so where, in an indictment, the offense
was charged as robbery, but as proved was, at most,
an improper and rude act, and intended only as a joke,
it was held that no robbery had been committed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
Miscellaneous</h2>


<p>INSOLVENT DEBTORS&mdash;"GRAB LAW."&mdash;When
a debtor is insolvent there are several
things that he may do. In the first place he may
do nothing. He may let his creditors try to get any
money out of him if they can, and in general let the
creditors take the laboring oar. Where there is no
bankruptcy law prevailing, either State or Federal&mdash;and
that was the situation in many of the States of
the Union prior to the passage of the present National
bankruptcy law&mdash;a debtor might get along
that way for a long time. That is one thing he
might do.</p>

<p>COMPOSITION WITH CREDITORS.&mdash;The
second thing the debtor may conceivably do is to try
to make a composition with his creditors. Though
it is the law that receiving a smaller sum will not discharge
a liquidated and undisputed debt for a larger
amount, even if it is so agreed, an exception is made
in the case of a composition where a number of creditors
agree that each of them will take a smaller sum
for his claim. The debtor may try to get his creditors
to do that, and occasionally he succeeds.</p>

<p>GENERAL ASSIGNMENTS.&mdash;A third thing
which he may do is to make a general assignment of
all his property to trustees in trust to pay his creditors
ratably. Such an assignment is not valid in
Massachusetts, though in most States it would be, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
free from fraudulent incidents. In Massachusetts it
would not prevent his creditors, or any one of them,
from attaching his property just as if it had not been
assigned, but if creditors assent to the assignment
then, to the extent of their claims, the assignment
becomes valid. In other States the assent of creditors
is presumed if the assignment is not fraudulent,
and therefore without any actual assent the situation
is the same as in Massachusetts after assent of all
the creditors.</p>

<p>FRAUDULENT INCIDENTS IN GENERAL
ASSIGNMENTS.&mdash;In every State a general assignment
under certain circumstances will be regarded as
fraudulent against creditors. Such a conveyance may
be treated as void by the creditors, and the property
conveyed seized by them as if the debtor had made
no conveyance. Some of these incidents which may
make a general assignment fraudulent may be noted.
If the assignor was solvent when the conveyance was
made, the transaction is fraudulent, for if he has sufficient
assets to pay his debts, the only object the assignment
can have is to prevent them from being
paid at once, and compel the creditors to wait until
the assignees under the deed realize upon the property,
that the debtor holds, at better advantage than
if a forced sale were made at once. If the assignees
are given unlimited power to continue business it is
also fraudulent, since the business would in effect be
carried on at the risk of the debtor. The debtor being
insolvent will lose nothing if the business proves
unprofitable whereas if profitable there may be a surplus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
after the payment of the debts. A provision
authorizing continuance of business so far as is necessary
to dispose of property on hand, or to work
up raw material on hand, is generally upheld. A provision
authorizing sales upon credit is often, though
not uniformly, held fraudulent, since it permits the
assignees to defer the settlement of the estate. The
most important provisions likely to be attacked as
fraudulent, however, are provisions in regard to preferences.
Aside from bankruptcy statutes, it is lawful
for a debtor who has insufficient means to pay all of
his creditors, to pay some in full, though this results
in the total exclusion of others. Accordingly a general
assignment of a debtor's property on a trust, that
the assignees shall pay in full certain named creditors
and pay the remaining creditors ratably out of the
residue, has generally been upheld though statutes in
some States have altered the law in this respect. A
kind of preference which is generally deemed fraudulent,
however, is one which is made conditional on
the creditors giving the debtor a discharge. A general
assignment, unlike a bankruptcy law, or a composition,
does not free the debtor from liability for
so much of his debt as remains unpaid. Debtors have
sometimes sought to avoid this result by making a
general assignment of their property in trust for
ratable distribution among such creditors as should
give the debtor a full release and discharge of all
claims. Such a provision, attempting, as it does, to
impose as a condition of a creditor's sharing, that he
should take his share in full satisfaction of his claim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
is almost universally held to make a general assignment
fraudulent. Under the bankruptcy law, a general
assignment may within four months be set aside
by bankruptcy proceedings; but a creditor who has
once assented to a general assignment cannot thereafter
join in a bankruptcy petition against that debtor.</p>

<p>BANKRUPTCY.&mdash;The fourth and most important
way, however, now, of settling the estates of insolvent
persons is provided by statute. The Federal
Constitution gives Congress power to pass uniform
laws on the subject of bankruptcy throughout the
United States, and the Supreme Court has held that
when the Federal Government has not taken advantage
of this privilege given by the Constitution, States
have power themselves to enact bankruptcy laws. In
some States there were such laws, but in many there
were not. The Federal law now supersedes all State
laws on the subject. It was passed in 1898, and under
that law the debtor may either become a bankrupt by
his own voluntary petition, or his creditors may petition
him into bankruptcy if he commits what is called
an "act of bankruptcy." This is true, at least, if the
debtor is an individual, or is a moneyed business or
commercial corporation (except railroads, insurance
companies, and banking corporations). When corporations
of the excepted class become insolvent, their
affairs are settled by still a fifth method&mdash;receivership.
A special privilege, also, is given to wage earners and
farmers. They may, if they choose, become voluntary
bankrupts, but are not liable to involuntary proceedings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<p>PETITIONS IN BANKRUPTCY.&mdash;Suppose a
debtor wishes to become bankrupt himself. He files
a petition in the United States District Court, which
is the court of bankruptcy jurisdiction, and is immediately
adjudicated a bankrupt. If his creditors want
to make him a bankrupt it is necessary that three of
them, having claims amounting to not less than $500
in the aggregate, should join, unless there are less
than twelve creditors in all. In that event one creditor
only may petition. This petition must set forth
(1) the creditors' claims, (2) the fact that the debtor
has committed an act of bankruptcy, and (3) the fact
that he owes debts aggregating $1,000 or more. However
slight his indebtedness, if he cannot pay it, a man
may be a voluntary bankrupt, but he must owe at
least $1,000 to be liable to involuntary proceedings.</p>

<p>ACTS OF BANKRUPTCY&mdash;FRAUDULENT
CONVEYANCES.&mdash;Now what are the acts of bankruptcy
which render a debtor liable to a petition by
his creditors? In the first place a fraudulent conveyance
is an act of bankruptcy. Reference to a fraudulent
conveyance by general assignment has been
made; but there are many kinds of fraudulent conveyances.
If a debtor who is insolvent, or who is
made insolvent through a gift made by himself, should
give away a portion of his property, that would be a
fraudulent conveyance, irrespective of the debtor's
intent, because the necessary effect of the gift would
be to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors. It would
be a fraudulent conveyance for a debtor to seek to
conceal his property from his creditors by putting it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
in the hands of some kind friend to hold for him until
his creditors should cease to be so troublesome as at
the present time. It would be a fraudulent conveyance
for a man who is pressed by creditors to turn
himself into a corporation for business purposes, and
assign all his property to that corporation. This
transfer to a corporation, even though done openly,
would necessarily hinder and delay his creditors.</p>

<p>PREFERENCES.&mdash;As has already been said,
paying one creditor to the exclusion of others is not
a fraudulent conveyance, but it is a preference, and a
preference is a second act of bankruptcy. Either for
the debtor to give a preference himself or to allow a
creditor to get a preference, by legal proceedings, is
an act of bankruptcy. Any transfer made by an insolvent
debtor, to pay or to secure in whole or in part
a previously existing debt, is a preference.</p>

<p>GENERAL ASSIGNMENTS.&mdash;A general assignment,
whether fraudulent or not, is an act of
bankruptcy. The consequence is, therefore, that if a
debtor makes a general assignment, his creditors have
the choice of letting it stand and having the estate
settled under the general assignment, or of setting it
aside and having bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

<p>RECEIVERSHIPS.&mdash;Still another act of bankruptcy
is the appointment of a receiver on account
of insolvency. There, also, the creditors virtually
have an option of letting the receivership stand and
having the receiver take charge of the distribution
of the assets, or of petitioning the debtor into bankruptcy
and having the bankruptcy court take charge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>ADMISSION OF INABILITY TO PAY
DEBTS.&mdash;One further act of bankruptcy is an admission
by the debtor of his inability to pay his debts
and his willingness to be adjudicated a bankrupt. An
act of bankruptcy can form the basis of a petition
only within four months after its commission.</p>

<p>INSOLVENT DEBTORS USUALLY COMMIT
ACTS OF BANKRUPTCY.&mdash;Now an insolvent
debtor cannot very well avoid committing one of
these acts of bankruptcy. He can avoid making a
fraudulent conveyance, but he will find it pretty hard
to avoid making a preference. He need not, it is true,
pay any of his debts, and it is not a preference to pay
money out for present consideration, or to transfer
property for present consideration, as to make a mortgage
for a new loan; but it will be hard for him to
prevent creditors from getting a preference by legal
proceedings, at least if the debtor has any assets at
all; for if the debtor does not pay any of his creditors,
some of his creditors will sue him, get execution, and
endeavor to levy it on the debtor's property.</p>

<p>PROCEDURE AFTER ADJUDICATION.&mdash;If
a debtor has once been adjudicated a bankrupt, it
makes no difference whether it was on a voluntary
petition or an involuntary petition; the matter goes
on in both cases the same way. The first thing, after
the adjudication, is, that the referee, a sort of subordinate
judge, requires the bankrupt to submit schedules
of his assets and of his creditors. The debtor is
induced to make these schedules as complete as possible,
for the following reasons: if the schedule of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
assets is knowingly incomplete, the debtor is committing
a crime and is likely to be shut up in jail. If
the schedule of his creditors is incomplete, any creditor
who is left out or whose address is so incorrectly
given that the creditor does not get notice of the proceedings
in time to prove his claim, is not affected
by the discharge; and as the debtor wants a discharge
from as many debts as possible, he, of course, will
make his schedule of creditors as complete as possible.
From this schedule of creditors, the referee sends
notices out to all the creditors to meet and choose the
trustee. The creditors meet and choose a trustee,
who then endeavors to collect the assets of the estate,
and under the direction of the court, pays dividends
from the assets to the creditors.</p>

<p>PROPERTY WHICH THE TRUSTEE GETS.&mdash;The
question may be asked: "What property does
the trustee get?" He gets all tangible property that
the debtor could transfer at the moment of his bankruptcy.
He gets intangible property, patents, trademarks,
copyrights, seats on the stock exchange, and
good-will of a business, with the exception that the
debtor still retains the right to carry on his old business
himself, in the future, in his own name. The
trustee gets rights of action of the bankrupt, except
personal rights of action, as they are called. These
consist of rights of action for personal injuries, as
for assault, or for personal injury by negligence. A
right of action for breach of promise of marriage also
would not pass to the trustee in bankruptcy. Not
only does a trustee get this tangible and intangible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
property, but he gets also a right to recover any property
fraudulently conveyed by the bankrupt, which
is not in the hands of a bona fide purchaser, even if
the fraudulent conveyance was made years before,
provided the statute of limitations has not completely
run against it. Any preference, also made within
four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy,
may be recovered from the preferred creditor,
if he had reasonable cause to believe, when he received
it, that he was getting a preference, but
not otherwise. The trustee in bankruptcy gets the
debtor's life insurance policies, except in so far as
they are made exempt by statute. Life-insurance
policies, in favor of a beneficiary other than the insured
himself, are exempt, though if the premiums
were paid by the debtor while insolvent, the premiums
so paid within the past six years may be recovered,
and the beneficiary would in effect have to
pay those premiums back in order to hold the policy.
Even if the policy runs to the insured himself, in his
own name, he has the privilege, under the bankruptcy
act, to redeem it from the trustee in bankruptcy by
paying its cash surrender value. Property acquired
by the bankrupt, after the beginning of bankruptcy
proceedings, does not pass to the trustee. The bankrupt's
property passes free of attachment or judgment
liens, secured by creditors within four months
prior to the beginning of bankruptcy proceedings.
This has no bearing on a case, where, prior to bankruptcy,
money has been actually collected by legal
proceedings, but only to cases of seizure under legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
proceedings which are still pending at the time the
petition is filed. If a debtor becomes bankrupt, within
four months after his property is attached, the attachment
is dissolved. If the debtor does not become
bankrupt until after four months, the attachment is
a valid lien on the property attached, and so far as
the property is sufficient to pay the creditor, he can
collect his claim from it, even though the debtor becomes
bankrupt before the creditor finally gets judgment
and collects his claim.</p>

<p>PROOF OF CLAIMS.&mdash;The trustee collects all
this property and tries to reduce it to cash, as fast as
he can, and while this is going on, creditors will also
be proving their claims. It is only claims which exist
at the time of filing the petition which are provable,
but the debts need not be due at the time of the bankruptcy;
it is only essential that they shall be in existence.
Interest is added or rebated, as the case
may be, to the date of filing the petition. That is, if
you have a non-interest-bearing note falling due July
1, and the debtor becomes bankrupt May 1, the face
of the note will be proved less a rebate of two months'
interest to May 1, because the present value of the
note on May 1 is what is provable. On the other
hand, if the note had been due on April 1, interest
would be added up to the date of filing the petition,
and if the note was an interest-bearing note, of course
the interest would be provable up to May 1, even if
the note did not fall due until July 1 or later. Debts,
arising subsequently to the date of filing the petition,
must be enforced against the bankrupt's assets acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
after his bankruptcy. Claims for tort are not
provable, that is, claims for injuries to person or property
not arising out of contact. But a judgment for
tort, obtained before the filing of the petition, is provable.
There has been a good deal of trouble in regard
to what are called contingent claims. The commonest
instance is the indorser's liability on a note which
is not yet due when the indorser becomes bankrupt.
At the time of filing the petition, the indorser's liability
is contingent on the possibility that the maker may
not pay the note at maturity, and that notice of dishonor
will be given to the indorser. Creditors, who
have received a preference, cannot prove claims unless
they have surrendered, within four months of the
bankruptcy, any preference which they have received
with reasonable cause to believe that it was a preference.
Secured creditors can realize on their security
and then prove for the balance of their claims. A
few claims are given priority over others and paid in
full before any dividend to other creditors. The most
important claims of this sort are the wages of workmen,
clerks or servants earned within three months
of the bankruptcy and not exceeding the sum of
$300.</p>

<p>LEASES.&mdash;Leases belonging to the bankrupt
pass to the trustee in bankruptcy, if he wants them,
but the trustee in bankruptcy need not take any kind
of property which seems more burdensome than beneficial
to him, and as a trustee would have to pay, the
rent under a lease in full, if he took it, he frequently
will prefer to abandon it. The landlord can prove for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
rent, which is already accrued, but he cannot prove
for rent which has not already accrued, even though
part of the period for which the rent is claimed has
elapsed, unless there is a special covenant in the lease.
If the trustee in bankruptcy assumed the lease, then,
of course, the landlord would look to the trustee for
the rest of the term. If the trustee did not assume
the lease, the landlord would have his option of doing
either of two things: he could leave the bankrupt in
the premises and have a right of action against him
for the rent, from time to time, as it accrued, or he
could eject the tenant; but if he ejected the tenant
he could not hold him for rent. Generally he would
eject a bankrupt tenant rather than let him stay.</p>

<p>SET-OFF.&mdash;Set-off may be made by a debtor of
the estate who also has a claim against the estate. He
does not have to prove his claim, taking a dividend
on it and then paying, in full, the debt which he owes
to the estate. He may set one off against the other,
but he is not allowed to acquire claims for the purpose
of set-off within four months prior to bankruptcy.
Otherwise, one owing money to an insolvent
debtor, could buy up at a discount claims against the
debtor, equal in amount to his indebtedness to the
bankrupt.</p>

<p>EXAMINATION AND DISCHARGE OF
BANKRUPT.&mdash;The bankrupt may be examined by
any creditor with a view to the disclosure of his assets.
This is a most important right. Finally, if
in every respect, he obeys the bankruptcy law, the
debtor gets a discharge. Grounds for refusing him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
a discharge are, that he has made a fraudulent conveyance;
that he has obtained credit by false representation;
that he has failed to keep books of account
for the purpose of concealing his financial condition;
that he has committed an offence punishable by the
bankruptcy law, as making a false oath or refusal to
disclose his property or to submit to examination;
and finally a debtor who has already been discharged
in bankruptcy within the previous six years cannot,
as a voluntary bankrupt, again obtain a discharge.
These are reasons for refusing a discharge altogether,
but even though a discharge is granted, certain liabilities
are not discharged. Claims for obtaining property
by false pretences, or for false representations,
are not discharged. Claims for defalcation or embezzlement,
as a public officer or as a fiduciary, and
claims for wilful and malicious injury to the property
of another, are not discharged. Nor are taxes or
claims for alimony or for the support of a wife or dependent
children.</p>

<p>COMPOSITION IN BANKRUPTCY.&mdash;At
common law it was necessary to have the consent of
all a debtor's creditors in order to make the composition
operative as against all of them. In bankruptcy
there is a special provision for composition, and with
the approval of the court, a composition may be declared
binding, not only as against those who have
assented to it, but as against all creditors having
provable claims, if a majority in number and amount
of the creditors, taking part in the bankruptcy proceedings,
assent to the discharge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p>INSURANCE.&mdash;Insurance is a contract whereby,
for an agreed premium, one party undertakes to
compensate the other for loss on a specified subject
from specified perils. Policies of insurance are as
various as the contracts which they cover. In 1779,
Lloyd's adopted a standard form of marine policy,
which, with some changes, is in practically universal
use in the British world. A standard form of fire
policy has been adopted by many of the fire insurance
companies in the United States.</p>

<p>POLICY PROVISIONS.&mdash;Certain terms occur
frequently in insurance law, with which one should
be familiar. A valued policy is one upon which a
definite valuation is put, by agreement of both parties,
on the subject matter of the insurance written on the
policy; for example, a policy "insuring the S.S. George
Washington, valued at $1,000,000." An open policy,
on the other hand, is one in which a definite sum is
written on the face of the policy, but instead of agreeing
as to the value of the property insured, indicates
the limit of recovery in case of the destruction of the
property. Floating policies are such as cover articles
which cannot be designated with certainty, as for example,
a constantly changing stock of goods. In life
insurance there are many kinds of policies. Probably
the most common is the regular life, under which the
insured pays certain fixed premiums throughout life,
and the beneficiary receives the amount of the policy
only upon the death of the insured. Life insurance
policies in which the investment feature is prominent,
are generally called endowment policies, and they require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
the insured to pay a certain premium, annually,
for a certain number of years. If the insured dies
before premium payments cease, under the terms of
the policy, the beneficiary receives the full amount
of the policy. If the insured lives beyond the stated
period, he is entitled to receive the amount written
on the face of the policy or he may be allowed to receive
a paid-up policy for some specified sum. A
policy of reinsurance is simply a contract made by
one insurance company with another, whereby the
first reinsures with the second some individual risk
which it has itself accepted and insured.</p>

<p>ELEMENTS OF CONTRACT.&mdash;In order that
the contract of insurance shall be valid, it must possess
all the essential elements of the ordinary contract.
Although there is a certain element of chance
in an insurance contract, it is always held that it is
not in the nature of a gambling contract. A peculiar
feature of this contract is that it is one of the utmost
good faith, and requires that each party shall disclose
to the other all material facts in his knowledge that
may affect the making of the contract.</p>

<p>INSURABLE INTEREST.&mdash;An essential element
in the law of insurance is that of insurable interest.
By this term we mean that interest of the insured,
which is exposed to injury by reason of the
peril insured against. Such interest does not necessarily
need to be a legal right, but only such as to
justify a reasonable expectation of financial benefit,
which will be derived by the continued existence of
the person or property insured. While it is difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
define accurately an insurable interest in property,
Section 2546 of the California Civil Code defines it
thus: "Every interest in property, or any relation
thereto, or liability in respect thereof, of such a nature
that a contemplated peril might directly damnify the
insurer, is an insurable interest." In life insurance,
an insurable interest is requisite, but this interest, if
existing at the time the policy is issued, is sufficient,
although such interest subsequently terminates. Every
person has an insurable interest in his own life,
or he may procure insurance on the life of another,
when so related to that other, either by reason of
blood, marriage, or commerce, that he has well-grounded
expectation of deriving benefit from that
other's life, or suffering detriment through its termination.
It is well settled that a creditor has an insurable
interest in the life of his debtor. The courts
are not clear as to just how much this interest is, but
it will not be allowed to greatly exceed the sum of the
debt. The relationship between the insured and the
insurer is governed, to a very large extent, by the law
of agency.</p>

<p>SURETYSHIP AND GUARANTY.&mdash;Suretyship
has been defined as an accessory agreement by
which one binds himself for another who is already
bound. A surety is a person who is liable to perform
any act, that his principal is bound to perform, in
the event that his principal fails to perform as agreed.
Where there is more than one surety, the parties are
known as co-sureties. The distinction between the
contract of suretyship and that of guaranty is not altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
clear, and frequently not observed by the
courts. So far as the distinction can be defined, we
may say that if the parties undertake to pay money,
or to do some other agreed act, in case the principal
fails to perform his part, then they are sureties. On
the other hand, if they assume performance, only in
the event that the principal is unable to perform, then
they are guarantors. The principles which apply to
both, are, in many respects, similar. The terms used
by the parties are not necessarily conclusive as to
whether it is a suretyship or guaranty relationship.
For example, in the case of Saint v. Wheeler, etc.,
Mfg. Co., 95 Ala. 362, where a contract was under
seal by which the parties "guarantee," along with one
of their number, to pay absolutely and irrespective of
solvency or insolvency, all damages which might result,
etc., it was held that the contract was one of
suretyship, and not of guaranty, although they had
used the express term "guarantee" in the language of
the contract.</p>

<p>QUALIFICATION OF A SURETY.&mdash;A surety
may be distinguished from an indorser in that the
undertaking of the surety is absolute, whereas that of
the indorser is conditional. The Negotiable Instruments
Act provides that a general indorser "engages
that on due presentment, it (the instrument) shall
be accepted or paid, or both, as the case may be, according
to its tenor, and that if it be dishonored, and
the necessary proceedings on dishonor be duly taken,
he will pay the amount thereof to the holder, or to
any subsequent indorser who may be compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
pay it." Hence, if an indorser is not notified, or if
the instrument is not protested, if that is necessary,
he is discharged.</p>

<p>PRINCIPAL AND SURETY.&mdash;Ordinarily, the
relationship of principal and surety is entered into
under the terms of a contract, the chief object of
which is the creation of the relationship. As a general
rule, any person who is capable of making a contract
may be surety. Formerly, it was sometimes said that
an infant was absolutely unqualified to make a contract
of this kind, but now his contracts of suretyship
are held to be voidable, the same as his other
contracts. In some states a married woman is still
prevented by statute from becoming a surety for her
husband. Like ordinary contracts, a contract of suretyship
must be supported by sufficient consideration.
It is ordinarily a collateral engagement to pay a debt
of another, and hence, comes under the section of the
Statute of Frauds which requires a contract to answer
for the "debt, default, or miscarriage of another,"
to be in writing.</p>

<p>SURETYSHIP LIABILITY.&mdash;The general extent
of the suretyship liability is measured by the
contract of the principal, which he guarantees. If
no cause of action can be maintained against the principal
on the contract, it follows necessarily that the
surety is not liable. The tendency of the courts is to
favor the surety. His obligation is ordinarily assumed
without any pecuniary compensation, and it is accordingly
said that his liability is "strictissimi juris,"
(strictly construed by the law). A surety has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
right, then, to insist upon the very letter of his contract,
and if there is a reasonable doubt as to whether
his contract requires the doing of certain acts or not,
that doubt should be resolved by the court in favor of
the surety. Consequently, a surety will not ordinarily
be held liable for any default of the principal,
which occurred prior to the surety's contract to be
such. The death of the surety does not necessarily
terminate his liability, and his personal representatives
will be responsible for the carrying out of his
contract, especially where the contract reads that the
surety "binds his heirs, executors and administrators."</p>

<p>SURETY'S OBLIGATION UNDER NEW
CONTRACT.&mdash;It frequently happens that the principal's
contract is not completed, and a renewal is
necessary. The question arises whether the surety's
obligations are continued under the new contract, the
same as under the old. The principle which the courts
apply is that if the renewal amounts to an entirely
new contract, then the surety's obligation is at an end.
But if the renewal is simply a part of the original
contract, and does not call for any new contract, his
obligation continues under such renewal. As the contract
between the principal and surety is of a more
or less confidential character, the law requires, as we
have mentioned in insurance, the exercise of the utmost
good faith on the part of the principal. Hence,
if a surety, before entering into his contract, applies
to the principal for information about any material
matter pertaining to the contract, the principal is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
bound to give full information as to every fact within
his knowledge, and if he does anything to deceive the
surety, he vitiates the contract. Another application
of the same principle is found in the rule that the
principal must not do any act injurious to the surety
or inconsistent with his rights. Consequently, if the
principal makes any arrangement with his principal
debtor, by which the risk of the surety is materially
increased, or the terms of the contract are altered or
varied or the time of payment is extended, the surety
in any of these cases would be released from any liability
unless he is consulted and gives his assent to
such changes in his contract. It is necessary that the
new contract, which the principal makes, be a valid
contract in order to release the surety. Hence, if the
principal makes a contract extending the time of the
payment on the obligation six months, and that is
all there is to the contract, such extension agreement
would be invalid because of lack of consideration, and
the surety in such case would not be discharged from
his liability under the old contract. If the obligation
which the surety undertakes to pay is a promissory
note, an agreement by the principal to extend the
time of payment, would not, of itself, release the
surety, there being no consideration. A part payment
made by the maker, before the note was due, for
which an extension of time to pay the remainder is
granted, would be binding, because such part payment,
before a note is due, constitutes good consideration
for an agreement to extend the time to pay the
balance, and consequently the surety is discharged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>NEGLIGENCE OF THE CREDITOR.&mdash;It is
generally true that the creditor is under no obligation
to be diligent in the pursuit of the debtor. Consequently,
a mere negligence of the creditor, to sue or
otherwise attempt to collect a claim against his debtor,
although there is a surety for the creditor, does
not relieve the surety of his liability. Mere delay,
then, in proceeding against the principal debtor, does
not release the surety, unless there is between the
creditor and principal debtor a valid and binding
agreement, under which a delay does prejudice the
surety.</p>

<p>DISCHARGE OF SURETY.&mdash;A surety is discharged
by the payment or performance, by the principal,
of the condition in the agreement. It is even
held that the surety is discharged if a tender of payment
has been made to the principal, after the debt
is due, and it is refused by him. In such a case, the
tender amounts practically to a payment of the debt
and a new loan creating a new contract. It sometimes
occurs that the creditor has collateral security for the
payment of the debt, or secures control of money or
property of the debtor and which he may lawfully
apply to the debtor's obligations under certain circumstances.
The principal may voluntarily surrender
or dispose of these securities. In such a case, the
surety is discharged from liability to the extent of
the value of the securities disposed of or surrendered.
Of course, the surety is not discharged where the
principal takes additional securities, or if some securities
are given up and sufficient are retained by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
principal to pay the debt, the surety is not relieved
and cannot complain, for the reason that he has not
been injured.</p>

<p>RIGHTS OF SURETY.&mdash;It is a well established
rule of law that where the surety is obliged to make
good on his contract he is entitled to relief, the law implying
a promise on the part of the principal to reimburse
the surety for any damages which he suffers.
Of course, this assumes that the surety was legally
bound to pay the debt. If he pays it because it is a
moral obligation or for any other reason which the
law does not recognize as legally binding, he is not
able to compel the principal to reimburse him.</p>

<p>RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION.&mdash;One of the
peculiar remedies, which the courts of equity have
developed, is that of contribution. This right is frequently
used in the law of suretyship. When one of
two or more sureties, for the same obligation, has
paid more than his share of the debt, he is entitled
to be reimbursed for the excess by his co-sureties.
This right is known as the right of contribution. As
has been said before, a surety, if he pays when he
is not legally bound to do so, must stand the loss himself;
and the same is true where he is one of several
co-sureties. Thus, if one co-surety pays a debt, which
is barred by the statute of limitations, he would not,
in that case, be entitled to contribution from his other
co-sureties.</p>

<p>SURETY COMPANIES.&mdash;Surety companies
conduct such a large business at the present time that
a word should be said about them in connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
this topic. The surety company is a corporation, and
its powers are, of course, defined by its charter, and
the laws of the State in which it is incorporated. In
general, surety companies are authorized to guarantee
performance of contracts and to execute bonds and
undertakings required by the courts. One tendency
is noticeable in recent years. The kind of suretyship,
we have been referring to, is generally that in which
the surety is an individual, who undertakes his
task for no consideration, and for that reason, as we
have said, the courts construe the contract of suretyship
strictly in favor of the surety. More and more,
now, the practice of the individual becoming a surety
is decreasing, and in his place the surety companies
offer their services in a more satisfactory manner, under
modern business conditions, but with the striking
difference, that the surety company offers its services
only for pay, which will net the company a profit.
Hence, the rule that the contract should be construed
strictly in favor of the surety does not fit the case of
the surety company which is paid for its services. In
the case of the American Surety Co. v. Paulu, 170 U. S.
133, and in many other cases, the rule is laid down,
that the contract will be construed against the surety
company and in favor of the indemnity which the
obligee has reasonable grounds to expect. So, it has
been held that a surety company will not be relieved
on its contract, by an extension of time to the principal,
and that there is no presumption that the surety
was injured by the extension unless the injury is
actually proved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>

<p>PATENTS.&mdash;The policy of encouraging monopolies,
while generally frowned upon, finds two exceptions
in the law of patents and copyrights. Consequently,
the Federal Constitution gives the exclusive
right to Congress to "promote the progress of
science and useful arts by securing for limited times,
to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their
respective writings and discoveries." The patent office
is located in Washington, and here the Commissioner
of Patents has his official office, and applications
for all patents are made through him, and he
is authorized to establish regulations for the granting
and issuance of patents. The duration of a patent
right depends, of course, upon the statute. At
the present time, the period is seventeen years, and at
the end of that time, the person holding the patent
must yield up his monopoly and all that pertains to it.
A patent is in the nature of a contract, and the United
States Supreme Court has said "The true rule of construction
in respect to patents and specifications, and
the doings generally of inventors, is to apply plain
and ordinary principles to them, as we have endeavored
to on this occasion, and not, in this most meta-physical
branch of modern law, to yield up to subtleties
and technicalities, unsuited to the subject, and
not in keeping with the liberal spirit of the age, and
likely to prove ruinous to a class of the community
so inconsiderate and unskilled in business as men of
genius and inventors usually are." A distinction is
usually made between pioneer patents, and patents
which are merely improvements on one already issued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
The former are always given a liberal interpretation,
while the latter should be strictly construed.</p>

<p>ELEMENT OF NOVELTY.&mdash;It is the element
of novelty which gives rise to the right to a patent.
It is not possible to discuss in this limited space, the
countless decisions upon this point. A thing may
be novel and entitled to a patent, although very old.
Some lost art of the Egyptians is re-discovered by
an American. Although the idea is several thousand
years old, to all practical purposes it is new, and the
inventor would be entitled to a patent. Like any
other property, an inventor's right may be lost by
abandonment. Thus, where an inventor taught a
large number of people, with no suggestion that the
thing was an experiment, and received pay for his
instruction, the court held that this constituted an
abandonment of his claim, and he was not entitled
to a patent.</p>

<p>INFRINGEMENTS.&mdash;A suit may be maintained
by the owner of a patent against one who infringes,
and as this is a matter under the United
States laws, all patent suits are tried in the Federal
courts. A patent right is personal property, and upon
the death of the owner, goes to his personal representative.
Patent rights, like other personal property,
may be assigned and sold.</p>

<p>SALE OF PATENTED ARTICLES.&mdash;In recent
years, many cases have arisen over the question
whether the manufacturers of patented articles are entitled
to impose conditions respecting the use of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
manufactured articles by purchasers. Early cases
seem to support the view that, as the theory of a patent
was that of a monopoly, these conditions would be
upheld even after the patented articles came into the
hands of a purchaser. Decisions of the United States
Supreme Court, however, have tended the other way.
So, attaching a notice to a patented article, stating
that the article is licensed for sale and use at a specified
price, and that the purchase is an acceptance of
these conditions, and that in the case of a violation
of this restriction, all rights revert back to the patentee,
cannot convert an otherwise apparently unqualified
sale into a mere license to use the invention. In
Bauer v. O'Donnell, 229 U. S. 1, the Supreme Court
said: "The right to vend conferred by the patent
law has been exercised, and the added restriction is
beyond the protection and purpose of the act. This
being so, the case is brought within that line of cases
in which this court, from the beginning, has held
that a patentee, who has parted with a patented machine,
by passing title to a purchaser, has placed the
article beyond the limits of the monopoly secured
by the patent act."</p>

<p>COPYRIGHTS.&mdash;A copyright is the exclusive
privilege of printing, or otherwise multiplying, publishing
and selling copies of literary or artistic productions.
The nature of a copyright is thus defined
by the United States Supreme Court, in the case
of Caliga v. Newspaper Co., 215 U. S. 158: "Statutory
copyright is not to be confounded with the
common law right. At common law, the exclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
right to copy existed in the author until he permitted
a general publication. Thus, when a book was published
in print, the owner's common law right was
lost. At common law, an author had a property in
his manuscript, and might have an action against
any one who undertook to publish it without authority.
The statute created a new property right, giving
to the author, after publication, the exclusive
right to multiply copies for a limited period. This
statutory right is obtained in a certain way, and by
the performance of certain acts which the statute
points out. That is, the author having complied with
the statute, and given up his common law right of
exclusive duplication, prior to general publication, obtained
by the method pointed out in the statute an
exclusive right to multiply copies and publish the
same for the term of years named in the statute. Congress
did not sanction an existing right; it created a
new one."</p>

<p>PROPERTY RIGHT IN IDEAS.&mdash;The doctrine
that a person has a property right in his ideas
has never been recognized, either by common law
or by statute. To illustrate: If A, in the course of
a conversation with B, gives his idea of what would
be a brilliant thought to work up into a detective
story, and B, possessing some literary ability, takes
the idea and writes a successful detective story, he is
entitled to the profits secured from the sale of the
book, and there is nothing that A can do about it.
The idea which A handed to B has been put by B
into such form that it is practicable to allow B to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
copyright it, and protect his property right in the
story. There is no practical way to protect a mere
idea.</p>

<p>EFFECT OF COPYRIGHT STATUTES.&mdash;One
must bear in mind the effect of copyright statutes
on common law rights. At common law, an
author has a property in his manuscript, and may
obtain redress for any attempt to deprive him of it,
and the copyright act provides that nothing in the
act shall limit the right of the author, at common
law, or in equity, to prevent the copying, publication
or use of an unpublished work, without his consent
and it gives him the right to damages should this
be done. At common law, the author of any literary
composition had an absolute property right in his
production, and he could not be deprived of it so
long as it remained unpublished. Interesting questions
have arisen in regard to the nature of the property
rights in letters. The question as to the rights
of the sender and the recipient are frequently troublesome.
The rights of the writer consist in the power
to make or restrain a publication by the recipient,
but he cannot prevent a transfer. The rights of the
recipient are those of unqualified title in the material
on which they are written. He has the right to keep
them, to read them, and show them to a limited
circle of friends, somewhat in the same way as a
family picture album might be used.</p>

<p>PROPERTY RIGHT IN INFORMATION
OR NEWS.&mdash;Another interesting question is as to
whether there can be any property right in information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
or news which has been collected at great expense
by the Associated Press or some similar organization.
The most important case on this question
is that of the International News Co. v. the Associated
Press, 248 U. S. 215. The Associated Press, organized
in New York, is a corporation created for the
purpose of collecting news and distributing it to
about 950 newspapers at an annual expense of about
$3,500,000. The International News Service was a
corporation organized in New Jersey to collect and
sell news to a chain of newspapers. The complaint
was made by the Associated Press that the International
News Service was engaged in pirating its news
in three ways: (1) By bribing employees of newspapers,
published by complainant's members, to furnish
Associated Press news to defendant, before publication,
for transmission by telegraph and telephone
to defendant's clients, for publication by them; second,
by inducing Associated Press members to violate
its by-laws and permit defendant to obtain news before
publication; and, third, copying news from early
editions of complainant's newspapers, and selling it,
either bodily or after rewriting it, to defendant's customers.
The court held that news should be regarded
as quasi-property, and that it was unfair competition
in business for the International News Service
to take from newspapers, which are members
of the Associated Press, news furnished by it, and refused
to modify the injunction issued by the District
Court restraining any taking or using of the Associated
Press news, either bodily or in substance, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
bulletins issued by the Associated Press, or any of
its members, or from editions of its newspapers,
until its commercial value to the complainant and all
of its members had passed away.</p>

<p>APPLICATION FOR COPYRIGHT.&mdash;The
formality of securing a copyright is comparatively
simple. The register of copyrights, in the library of
Congress at Washington, furnishes a blank which
the applicant fills out and returns, giving the required
information, and on or before the first day of publication,
the applicant must send two copies of the
copyrighted book to the library of Congress. The
copyright is good for twenty-eight years, with a right
to renewal. The works for which copyrights may be
secured may be classified as: (a) Books, including
composite and cyclopedic books, directories, gazetteers,
and other compilations; (b) periodicals, including
newspapers; (c) lectures, sermons, and addresses,
prepared for oral delivery; (d) dramatic or dramatic-musical
compositions; (e) musical compositions; (f)
maps; (g) works of art, models or designs for works
of art; (h) reproductions of a work of art; (i) drawings
or plastic works of scientific or technical character;
(j) photographs; (k) prints and pictorial records.
There are certain things, which, while technically
they are under the classification we have given,
are not subject of copyright. The opinions handed
down by the judges of all of our courts, although
they are in the form which would ordinarily permit
copyright, are not subject of copyright because of the
general principle of law that a judge receives a stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
annual salary and cannot, therefore, have any pecuniary
interests in the fruits of his judicial labors. This
does not mean, however, that the opinions of the
United States Supreme Court, for example, are not to
be found in a copyrighted book. The Supreme Court
Reporter, which is one of the systems of reporters
published by the West Publishing Co. as a purely
commercial enterprise, is copyrighted by that company.
This is because of the fact that the editorial
staff of the West Publishing Co. prepares a syllabus
for each opinion, an exhaustive index in each volume,
and a table of cases, and all of this matter arranged
by that company, is subject to copyright, and they
have the right to use the opinions of the Supreme
Court the same as any other publisher would have.
Again, a copyright might be refused on the grounds
that the book on which the copyright was sought
was an immoral or obscene writing, and therefore not
entitled to protection of the copyright law. The word
"Copyrighted" accompanied by the name of the copyright
proprietor should appear on the page opposite
the title page, or if the article copyrighted is a picture,
the act provides that the device, accompanied
by the initials or the symbol of the copyright proprietor,
shall appear on the article.</p>

<p>SUBJECTS OF COPYRIGHT.&mdash;In the classification
we have just given, mention is made of lectures,
sermons, etc., as being the subject of copyright.
It is held, however, that a lecture, delivered orally to
a class of students, is not published to the extent that
the instructor loses his right to it, although the students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
may be allowed to make notes for their own
use. In the same way, the artist does not lose his
common law copyright by an exhibition of his pictures
in his studio or in a public gallery where they
are placed for sale. Similarly the public presentation
of a dramatic production does not deprive the owner
of his rights in it. The reason for this is that at
common law the public performance of a play does
not mean an abandonment to the public generally.</p>

<p>TRADE MARKS AND TRADE NAMES.&mdash;A
trade mark or trade name is a mark or symbol which
the tradesman puts upon his goods, so that they may
be identified and known by the public generally. A
trade name differs from a trade mark in that it is descriptive
of the manufacturer himself, and involves the
individuality of the maker. Statutes will be found
covering the registration of trade marks and trade
names, but the protection which the law affords the
owner of these is not confined to a statute alone. It
is generally held that a trade mark, subject to some
qualifications, arises without the aid of any statute.</p>

<p>SUBJECT MATTER OF TRADE MARK OR
TRADE NAME.&mdash;The question as to what is the
subject-matter of a trade mark or a trade name, can
only be determined by a careful reading of the cases.
A trade mark may consist of a name, a symbol, a letter,
some arbitrary form, or a newly-coined word.
Pictures of animals, coats of arms, and the like, are
frequently used. No trade mark can be obtained by
the mere use of a color or generally a geographical
term, nor can a trade mark be obtained from the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
of a package in which goods are packed, and generally,
mere letters and numbers cannot form a trade
mark, although the arbitrary combination of numbers,
such as "Babbitt's 1776" may be a valid trade
mark.</p>

<p>NAMES NOT VALID TRADE MARKS.&mdash;Generic
names, and merely names of articles, are not
valid trade marks, as "Extract of Wheat," and "New
York Cough Remedy." A trade name of a firm, a
corporate name, or the name of a publication, although
they are not strictly trade marks, are, nevertheless,
of the same nature as a trade mark, and will
be protected in the same manner.</p>

<p>UNFAIR COMPETITION.&mdash;The most common
way in which trade marks and trade names become
the subject of litigation, is in connection with
unfair competition. By this term we mean, ordinarily,
the imitation by one person, for the purpose of deceiving
another, of the name, device, or symbol used
by a business rival. The courts act in such cases
upon the theory that the public should be protected,
and should not have other goods pawned off on it
in place of something else which a person thinks he
is getting. This matter of unfair competition is the
subject of much litigation in the courts, and one or
two illustrations will show how the question arises.
For example: In an English case, decided in 1897, the
plaintiff had manufactured and sold a relish which
was made under a secret recipe and was sold under
the name "Yorkshire Relish." The defendant then
put a sauce on the market resembling it, and sold it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
under the name of "Yorkshire Sauce." The court
held that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction.
In the case of the International Silver Co. v. the Rogers
Co., 66 N. J. Equity 119, the court enjoined the use
of the word "Rogers" in the corporate title of the
William H. Rogers Corporation, on the ground that
its use was a part of the proceedings by which the
public were deceived. In this case a manufacturer
of silverware, in Plainfield, N. J., was attempting to
trade upon the reputation of the "1847" brand of plated
silver made by the Rogers Company of Connecticut,
which company was at the time of the action,
a constituent part of the International Silver Co.
The Connecticut Company had built up a large and
good reputation by a long period of sales of its silverware
to the public under its trade devices, and the
use of its business name. The New Jersey Company
was simply attempting to trade on that reputation,
which is almost always the case in unfair competition.</p>

<p>CONFLICT OF LAW.&mdash;Although we have referred
to the uniform legislation in the various topics
of commercial law which we have been considering,
there is still much in the subject of conflict of law
which concerns the student of commercial law. International
law is commonly divided into two
branches, public and private. Public is that which
regulates the political intercourse of nations with
each other; private, that which regulates the comity
of States in giving effect in one to the municipal laws
of another relating to private persons. Conflict of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
law is one division of the broader subject of international
law and is frequently called private international
law. In the sense in which we are now using
the term, the various States of the Union are considered
as foreign to each other. The problems embraced
in this topic and their bearing on commercial law may
be more fully appreciated if we take a simple illustration.
A stock broker with offices in New York City
seeks to sell the stock of a new oil mining company
to a purchaser in Indiana. The sale is one which is
not allowed by the Indiana "blue sky" law. New
York has no such law. The sale is effected by
means of circulars and correspondence between
the New York broker and the Indiana purchaser.
Is this transaction to be governed by the law of
Indiana or of New York? Its validity will depend
upon our answer to that question and this
is the type of question one has to answer on the
subject of conflict of law. With approximately forty
different "blue sky" laws in the country at present,
and the great number of stock transactions carried
on between the States, the importance of this topic
may be appreciated. Again, even where we have a
uniform act as, for example, the Uniform Negotiable
Instruments Act, there are still differences in the law
in some States. Each statute must be interpreted by
the courts, and although the judges are sincere in
their efforts, it can not be expected that we will always
have a uniform interpretation of the same act
by the courts in each and every jurisdiction of the
United States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<p>FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.&mdash;There are
several fundamental principles we should keep in
mind before we turn to the specific branches of commercial
law as affected by our topic. The term comity
is one of common use in conflict of law and is defined
as the recognition which one nation or State allows
within its territory to the legislative, executive, or
judicial acts of another nation or state. Comity is not
a matter of right, but a courtesy, and one country may
exercise its right and prohibit citizens of other countries
from suing in its courts. Of course the various
States of the United States are not as completely free
in this matter as separate countries, because of the
provision in the Federal Constitution guaranteeing
to the citizens of each State all the privileges and immunities
of citizens in the several States. There are
still many questions which are not affected by the
Federal Constitution. For example, a suit is brought
in New Jersey upon a contract of suretyship made in
New York by a wife for her husband. There is a
statute in New Jersey prohibiting a married woman
from doing this. New York has no such statute.
Shall the New Jersey court enforce the contract which
the parties made in New York but which they could
not have made in New Jersey? Under the principle
of comity a New Jersey court has held valid such a
contract. Again, it is entirely conceivable that a person
living in Turkey might make a binding contract
to marry three women at the same time. Suppose the
Turk before the time for performing the contract arrives,
comes to New York and then refuses to marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
the three women. Could they sue him for a breach
of contract in the New York court? Clearly not. Here
they would be asking the New York court to enforce
a contract which while admittedly valid, when made
in Turkey, is decidedly against the public policy of
any monogamous country. Comity being a courtesy,
not a right, would not require a New York court to
recognize the Turkish contract. In our illustration
of the wife acting as surety, no question of public
policy was involved and hence there was no impropriety
in New Jersey recognizing as valid her contract,
although such a contract could not have been
made within the State of New Jersey.</p>

<p>CONFLICT OF LAW AS RELATING TO
THE STATUS OF PROPERTY.&mdash;As we have
pointed out heretofore, property is divided into real
property and personal property. Reference should
be made to the distinctions between these two kinds
of property as described in a preceding chapter. Suppose
A dies intestate in Texas owning real property
in New York. The law relating to the descent of real
property is different in Texas from that in New York.
A's heirs wish to know by which law this New York
real estate will be governed. It is almost universally
recognized that all matters concerning the title and
disposition of real property are determined by what
is known as the lex loci rei sitae, that is, the law of
the place where the property is situated. Accordingly
the heirs in Texas would be governed by the law of
the State of New York and, similarly, if A had also
owned property in Illinois, that property would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
governed by the Illinois law. Suppose, also, A had
owned $50,000 worth of stock in various corporations
and he kept one-half of this stock in his safe deposit
box in Galveston and the other half in New York
City. While the dominion of a State over personal
property within its borders is complete, nevertheless
by virtue of the principles of comity, the rule has been
recognized almost from time immemorial that personal
property is governed by the law of the domicile
of the decedent at the time of his death. Hence A's
stocks (and bonds for that matter) would be divided
according to the law of Texas whether they were in
his safe deposit box in Galveston, New York City, or
Chicago. It follows, when no rights of creditors intervene,
that the law of the domicile of the testator
will control in regard to his will of personal property,
and the law of the place where the real property is situate
will control in regard to it.</p>

<p>CONFLICT OF LAW AS RELATING TO
CONTRACTS.&mdash;It is a general principle of contract
law that the construction and validity of a contract
is governed by the lex loci contractus, the law of the
place where the contract is made. When the contract
is made in one jurisdiction and is to be performed in
another, the question becomes more difficult. The
Supreme Court of the United States, in Scudder v.
Union Nat. Bank, 91 U. S. 406, has laid down the following
rules in reference to the law governing contracts
in cases in which the place of making and the
place of performance are not the same. "1. Matters
bearing upon the execution, interpretation and validity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
are determined by the law of the place where the
contract is made; 2. Matters connected with the performance
are regulated by the law of the place where
the contract by its terms is to be performed; 3. Matters
relating to procedure depend upon the law of the
forum (i. e., the court where the case is heard)." These
three general rules have been adopted and applied by
many jurisdictions in a long line of cases involving
every conceivable kind of contract. But perhaps it is
even more generally stated, when the contract is to be
performed in a place other than the place where it is
made, that the law of the place where the contract is
to be performed will determine the validity, nature, obligation
and effect of the contract, or, in other words,
in case of conflict the lex loci solutionis (the law of
the place of performance) will prevail over the lex
loci contractus. Although these statements at first
seem somewhat contradictory, we may always apply
another rule which is a sound test for the determination
of the proper law to be applied. We may properly
say that the intention of the parties should control
and it is generally agreed that the law of the
place where the contract is made is, prima facie, that
which the parties intended to govern the contract,
and in the absence of a contrary intention ought to
control. It frequently happens that a contract made
in one State is sued upon in the courts of another
State. The law governing the procedure in the trial
of this case will be the law of the forum, that is of the
State where the case is tried, regardless of what the
law may be on the same matter in the State where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
the contract was made. There may be, for example,
a peculiar rule as to a wife's being able to testify on
the contract in question. This rule will be enforced
by the court although no such rule existed in the State
where the contract was made. There is no great
hardship in the application of such principles because
the courts of the State where the contract was made
are open to the parties, and if they wish to avail
themselves of the services of a court in a different
jurisdiction they must take it as they find it with its
rules of procedure.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATION.&mdash;There is another type of
contract which involves the question of conflict of
law to which attention should be called. The facts
in the case of Fonesca v. Cunard Steamship Company
153 Mass. 553, illustrate this point. A passenger on
one of the steamships of the Cunard Steamship Company
bought a ticket in Liverpool for Boston and on
the ticket was a clause providing that the steamship
company should not be liable for any damage to a passenger's
baggage during transit, regardless of
whether the steamship company was negligent in
handling the baggage. When the passenger arrived
in Boston, and her trunk was delivered, it was found
that the contents had been damaged by sea water due
to the steamboat company negligently leaving a porthole
open. The passenger sued, and the Massachusetts
court held there could be no recovery for the
damage, for, although such a clause exempting a carrier
for his negligence was not valid under the Massachusetts
law (and in fact the law of practically all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
American jurisdictions), nevertheless, since the law
of England permits such a clause, and this was an
English contract, the ticket having been bought in
Liverpool, the passenger was bound by the terms
of her contract. There are many kinds of contracts
of transportation of baggage, of passengers
and of telegraph messages, involving the carrying out
of such contracts in many different States. Not all
of the decisions in the various States of this country
are harmonious. We must expect to find many such
problems in business and the answer is often one that
requires most careful study on the part of a lawyer.</p>

<p>CONFLICT OF LAW AS RELATING TO
NEGOTIABLE PAPER.&mdash;There is not so large a
field for questions of conflict of law to come up in
negotiable paper as in some of the other topics we
have been considering. Forty-seven States have now
passed the Uniform Negotiable Instrument Law. But,
as we have pointed out, the interpretation of this law
in the various States is not invariably uniform. Suppose
a promissory note has six indorsers. Every indorsement
is governed by the law of the State where
it was made, and should there be a different law in this
matter, we would at once have a question in conflict
of law. Again, in determining the negotiability of a
document made in one place and payable in another,
we have a further question in conflict of law. The
authorities do not agree here although perhaps we
may say the majority hold that the law of place or
payment controls. These problems will be considered
in the text-book on Negotiable Instruments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p>CONFLICT OF LAW AS RELATING TO
INTEREST AND USURY.&mdash;We find a variety of
usury laws throughout the United States. Some few
States allow the lender to charge any rate of interest.
Others allow a fixed rate, usually 6%, and provide
that the lender forfeits both principal and interest if
he charges more. Still others allow a fixed rate and
provide that interest only is forfeited if a higher rate
is charged. It is easy to see that a contract made in
one State may be sued upon in another State and the
usury laws of the two States may be entirely different.
We may say as a general rule that usury laws do
not offend any principles of public policy. There is
nothing wrong in asking a New York court, where
the legal rate of interest is 6%, to enforce a contract
made in a State where a higher rate is allowed. On
the other hand, no New York court would allow citizens
of New York simply to date a contract Boston,
Massachusetts, and provide for a 10% interest rate,
thereby hoping to evade the New York Usury law,
when, except for the date on the contract, it was in
reality wholly a New York contract.</p>
